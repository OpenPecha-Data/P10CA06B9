XVI. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ACTS OF THE BUDDHA

We have finished the explanation of the ‘Immaculate Properties of the Buddha’. Now we shall
speak of the functions [aśociated with those Properties], i. e. ‘the Acts of the Buddha’.
They are said to be manifested in two modes, i. e. ‘without effort’, and ‘uninterruptedly’.
[Therefore] immediately there follow two ślokas referring to the Buddha’s Acts which are
characterized as ‘of no effort and interruption’.

(Kārikās 1-2) The acts of the Lord are always effortless With regard to the constitution of
the converts, The means of conversion, and its functions [In accordance with the capacity]
of the converts, Working in [proper] place and in [proper] time. || 1 ||Having completely
established the Vehicle; The ocean of knowledge filled with the multitudes of the excellent
virtues, And endowed with the rays of the sun of Merits and Knowledge, And having perceived
that Buddhahood, like space, Pervading extensively and of neither limit nor middle, Exists
everywhere in all living beings, As the treasure of the immaculate virtues, The Buddhas’
Compassion, like wind, Blows away the net of the cloud-like [Obscurations] Caused by
Defilements and Ignorance. || 2||The summarized meaning of these two ślokas is to be known
by the following two and eight verses, respectively. To whom, by what means, how far, and
when, About these matters, there is no rise of discrimination; Therefore, the Buddha’s Act
of conversion Is [working] always ‘without effort’. || 3 ||On account of the action of conversion,
‘Who’ means ‘the constitution to be converted’, ‘By what means’ denotes ‘the manifold
means of conversion]’ And ‘where and when’ the ‘place and time [of conversion]’. ||
4||Because, [this act of conversion is] non-discriminative With regard to Deliverance and
its support, To the result of [partaking of] this support and the receptacle which accepts
this result, And to the obscurations [which cover] this receptacle and the condition by
which these obscurations are removed. || 5||[Here], ‘Deliverance’ means the 10-fold Stage
[of Bodhisattvas], ‘Its cause’ means the 2-fold Accumulation, ‘The result of this Accumulation’
is the Highest Enlightenment, ‘[Its] receptacle’ means the living beings Who accept
the Enlightenment. || 6 ||The phrase ‘The obscurations which cover this receptacle’ means
The innumerable Defilements, Sub-defilements and Impressions; The phrase ‘The condition by
which the obscurations are removed And which works for all time’ means Compassion. || 7||These
six points are to be known, Like the ocean and like the sun, Like space and like a treasure,
Like clouds and like the wind, respectively. || 8 ||Being [the treasure] of the water
of knowledge And of the jewel of virtuous properties, The highest Vehicle is like the
ocean; As keeping alive all living beings, The twofold Accumulation is like the sun; || 9
||Being extensive and of neither end nor middle, The Enlightenment has a resemblance to space;
Being of the nature of the Perfect Enlightened One, The living beings are akin to a
treasure; || 10 ||Being accidental, pervasive, and unreal, Their defilements are like a multitude
of clouds; And, bringing about the dispelling of these, Compassion is like a strong
wind. || 11 ||Performing Deliverance for the sake of others, Considering the living beings
as one’s own self, And having works of no termination, [The Buddha] Acts ‘uninterruptedly’
as long as the world exists. || 12 ||
