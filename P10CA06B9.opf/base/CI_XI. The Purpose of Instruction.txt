XI. THE PURPOSE OF INSTRUCTION

[Someone may ask]: If this Essence [of the Buddha] is thus so difficult to be cognized inasmuch
as it is not fully accessible even to the Saints of the Highest rank who are abiding on
the Stage characterized as being completely free from any attachment, then what is the use
of this instruction to the ignorant and ordinary beings? [For replying to this question],
we have two ślokas summarizing the purpose of instruction. [Of them], one is the question,
and the second is the answer.

(Kārikās 58-59) It has been said here and there [in the Scriptures] That all things are to be
known everywhere As being ‘unreal’, like clouds, [visions in] a dream, and illusions; Whereas,
why has the Buddha declared here That the Essence of the Buddha, exists ‘in every living
being? || 156 ||There are defects [caused by the previous teaching]: The depressed mind,
contempt against those who are inferior, Clinging to things unreal, speaking ill of Truth,
And besides, affection for one’s self. [The teaching about Essence of the Buddha] has
been taught In order that those who are possessed of these defects Might get rid of their
defects. || 157 ||The meaning of these two ślokas is briefly to be known by the following
ten verses. It has been said [in the Scriptures] All kinds of phenomena, made by causes
and conditions And known in the forms of Defilement, Action and Result, Are, like clouds,
etc., deprived of reality. || 158 ||The Defilements are like the clouds, Undertaking of Actions
is like the enjoyment in a dream; Being the Results made by Defilements and Actions,
The Group of elements are like illusions made by magic. || 159 ||So has it been ascertained
‘before’; But now, in this ‘ultimate’ Doctrine, In order to remove the defects [caused
by the previous teaching], It is shown that the Essence of the Buddha exists. || 160 ||Indeed,
if [the people] have not heard of this teaching, Some of them, being possessed of depressed
mind, May have a fault of self-depreciation, and hence, The Will towards the Enlightenment
does never arise in them. || 161 ||Even if someone has resolved towards Enlightenment,
Then he, being proud of it, saying: I am superior to [others], Will produce the notion
of inferiority for those Whose mind is not aroused towards Enlightenment. || 162 ||With
him who thinks like that, The true knowledge will never arise, and hence, He clings to unreal
things [as if they were real] And does not cognize the true meaning. || 163 ||[Indeed],
the defects of living beings are unreal Because they are non-genuine and accidental But
the non-substantiality of such defects is real, That is, the virtues [of living beings], pure
by nature. || 164 ||If a man of intelligence perceives [only] That the defects [of living
beings] are unreal, And depreciates [their] virtues which are real, He cannot obtain benevolence
by which One regards [other] living beings as equal to oneself. || 165 ||On the
contrary, if one hears of this teaching, There arises in him great exertion, Respect [for
all living beings] as for the Teacher, Intuition, Wisdom, and great Benevolence; These properties
having become originated, || 166 ||He, being free from [self-] depreciation, Obtaining
equal regard [for every body], Being devoid of defects and possessed of virtues, Having
love, equally for himself and for living beings, Attains the State of Buddha at an early
date. || 167 ||

Finished is the first Chapter entitled ‘the Matrix of the Tathāgata’ in the ANALYSIS OF THE
GERM OF THE JEWELS, a Treatise on the Ultimate Doctrine of the Great Vehicle, with the commentary
[named] ‘the Summary of Meaning of the ślokas’.
