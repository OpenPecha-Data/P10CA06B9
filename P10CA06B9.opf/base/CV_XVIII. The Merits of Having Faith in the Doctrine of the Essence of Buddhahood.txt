XVIII. THE MERITS OF HAVING FAITH IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHAHOOD

(§1. The Superiority of Faith over Other Virtues in Regard to Their Merits.) Hereafter, with
reference to the advantage of faith possessed by those who are believing in these [4] subjects
which have been duly described above, we have six ślokas.

(Kārikās 1-6) The Essence of Buddhahood, the Enlightenment of the Buddha, The Buddha’s Properties,
and the Buddha’s Acts, They are inconceivable even to those of the pure mind, Being
the exclusive sphere of the Leaders. || 1 ||But the wise one, whose intellect accepts the
faith In this exclusive sphere of the Buddha, Becomes a receptacle of the whole collection
of properties, And, being possessed of the desire [to obtain] The inconceivable properties
[of the Buddha], He surpaśes the abundance of merits of all living beings. || 2 ||Suppose
there were one who, being anxious to obtain the Enlightenment, Would offer golden lands,
constructed by jewels As innumerable as the sands in the Buddha’s lands, To the Lord of
Doctrine, always, day after day; Another if he hear but one word of this teaching, After hearing
of it, would have faith in this Doctrine; The latter would reap merits far more than
the merits of an offering. || 3 ||Suppose a wise man, being desirous of the Highest Enlightenment,
Would keep pure moral conduct by his body, speech and mind, Without effort, in
course of innumerable aeons; Another, if he hear but one word of this teaching, After hearing
of it, would have faith in this Doctrine; The latter would reap merits far more than the
merits of morality. || 4 ||Suppose one would give himself up to the mystic absorption;
Which suppreśes the fire of defilements in the worlds, And, having been transferred to the
abode of Brahman in heaven, Would be irreversible from the means of Enlightenment; Another,
if he hear but one word of this teaching, After hearing of it, would have faith in this
Doctrine; The latter would reap merits far more than even the merits of the mystic absorption.
|| 5 ||Charity brings people only to [worldly] enjoyment, Morality leads people to the
blissful world, And meditation is conducive to the removal of Defilements, But the Transcendental
Intellect can remove All [the obscurations of] defilements and ignorance. Therefore,
Intellect is the supreme one [of all virtues] And its very source is the study of this
Doctrine. || 6 ||The summarized meaning of these ślokas should be known by the following
9 verses. The basis [of Buddhahood], its transformation, Its properties and the performance
of welfare, In these four aspects of the sphere of Buddha’s Wisdom, Which have been explained
above, || 7 ||The wise one has become full of faith With regard to its existence,
power and virtue, Therefore, he quickly attains the potentialit yOf acquiring the state of
the Tathāgata. || 8 ||Indeed, as he is full of devotion and faith That there exists ‘this’
inconceivable sphere, That it ‘can’ be realized by one like him, And this sphere, ‘endowed
with such virtues’ has been attained, || 9 ||So in him the mind intent on Enlightenment,
Being a receptacle of virtues like zeal, energy, Memory, contemplation, Transcendental Intellect,
etc., Comes to exist always. || 10 ||As this mind constantly exists, The son of
the Buddha becomes irreversible, And he reaches the accomplishment and the perfect purity,
With regard to the Highest of Merits. || 11 ||‘The [Highest of] Merits’ means the [first]
Highest virtues, ‘Its accomplishment’ is owing to his being non-discriminative With regard
to the three aspects [of activity], And ‘the perfect purity’ is caused by his removal of
the opponents. || 12 ||Charity is the merit consisting of granting gift, Morality is the
merit consisting of moral conduct, And both Patience and Meditation, is that of practice,
But Exertion is the merit common to all. || 13 ||Discrimination regarding the aspects of activity,
That is the Obscuration of Ignorance; The opponents [to the Highest Virtues], jealousy,
etc., They are the Obscurations of Defilements. || 14 ||But, without the Highest Intellect,
The other cannot be the cause of their removal; Therefore, the Highest Intellect
is the supreme one of all, And, as the source of it is the study [of this Doctrine], It is
this study that is the most important. || 15 ||(§2. Authority, Motive, and Characteristics
of This Text Being the Correct Doctrine.) [Hereafter we have ślokas mentioning on which
basis, for what motive, and how this doctrine has been explained and what characteristics
it has. First of all, with reference to the basis and motive, there is one śloka]. (Kārikā
7) Thus, on the basis of the authoritative Scripture and of Logic, This treatise is expounded
by me in order to attain Perfect purification for myself, exclusively; At the same time,
however, this is in order to aśist Those intelligent people who are endowed with faith
And accomplishment of virtues. || 16 ||[Next we have one śloka stating how this treatise
is explained]. (Kārikā 8) Just as, with the aid of a lamp, of lightning, Of a precious stone,
of the moon and the sun, Those possessed of vision can perceive objects; Similarly, I
have expounded this treatise Relying upon the Lord who is the sun Manifesting the Doctrine
of great welfare. || 17 ||[Then we have one śloka stating the characteristics of the correct
doctrine]. (Kārikā 9) Whatever the word that is connected with the scriptural texts It
pursues the [ultimate] aim [of living beings], Is conducive to removing the Defilements in
the Worlds, And can demonstrate the advantage of Quiescence, Such a word is that of the
Great Sage, And all others are of perverse character. || 18 ||[Next we have one śloka stating
by what means this treatise is explained]. (Kārikā 10) Whatever is spoken by those whose
mind is not distracted And who refer to the Lord as the only Preceptor, And is favourable
to the Path of the [2] Accumulations which lead to Emancipation, That is also to be accepted
with respect As if it were taught by the Great Sage. || 19 ||(§3. The Means of Preserving
Oneself within the Doctrine.) [Here we have two ślokas referring to the means of preserving
oneself from becoming deprived (of this Doctrine)] (Kārikās 11-12) Indeed in this
world there is no one wiser than the Buddha, No other who is omniscient and knows completely
The highest Truth according to the right method; Therefore, the Scripture should not be
interpolated, Which is discoursed by the Sage himself, Otherwise, it will do harm to the
Highest Doctrine Because of destroying the teaching of the Buddha. || 20 ||The fact that people
abuse the Sages And blame the doctrine taught by the Sages, All this is the Defilement
of those whose nature is foolish And is created by a prejudiced conception; Therefore,
your mind should not be attached To the dirt of the prejudiced conception; Indeed, only clean
cloth can be dyed But not one that is spoiled by oil and dust. || 21 ||(§4. Causes and
Results of the loss of the Doctrine.) [With reference to the causes of the loss of the Doctrine,
there is one śloka]. (Kārikā 13) Want of intelligence, want of faith in the virtuous
Doctrine, Indulgence in false pride, Obscured nature through the rejection of the Highest
Doctrine, Interpretation of the conventional sense as the [ultimate] Truth, Greediness,
[adherence to] false conception, Devotion to those who hate the Doctrine, Keeping at distance
from those who convey the Doctrine, And delighting in the inferior Doctrine, By all this,
one becomes deprived of the Doctrine of the Saint. || 22 ||[With reference to the result
of this loss, there are two ślokas]. (Kārikās 14-15) The wise one need not be so much
afraid of fire, Of violent poison of snake, of murder, or of lightning, As he should be afraid
of the loss of the profound Doctrine, Because a fire, a snake, an enemy, and lightning,
At most, may deprive one of [this] life But one will not go, by these causes, To the most
terrible world of Avīci. || 23 ||Even one who, repeatedly serving bad friends, Is hostile
to the Buddha, and commits the acts Of killing mother, father, and the Saints, And breaks
the unity of the Highest Community, Even that one can quickly become delivered from that
sin If he meditates upon the meaning of the Doctrine; But, how would it be pośible for the
Liberation to arise In one whose mind is hostile to the Doctrine! || 24 ||(§5. Conclusion.)
[Here, at the end we have one śloka in order to turn the merit acquired by the author
through this teaching towards the people]. (Kārikā 16) I have thus duly expounded the subjects,
The Jewels, the perfectly pure Essence, The Immaculate Enlightenment, the [Buddha’s]
Properties and Acts; By the merit I have acquired through this, May all living beings come
to perceive The Lord Amitāyus endowed with infinite light, And, having seen him, may they,
owing to the arising Of the immaculate vision of the Doctrine in them, Obtain the Supreme
Enlightenment. || 25 ||The summary of topics discussed in these 10 ślokas (vv. 16-25)
should be known by the following verses. Owing to what basis, for what motive, How and what
is expounded [in this treatise], And what is the natural outflow [of the Buddha’s Doctrine],
These topics are explained by the [first] ślokas. || 26 ||Two ślokas refer to the means
of self-protection, And one, to the cause of the loss [of the Doctrine], And then, the
[following] two ślokas Explain the result of this loś. || 27 ||And finally, the acceptance
[of the Doctrine] By those living in the world of Saṃsāra And their acquisition of Enlightenment;
In short, these results of teaching of the meaning Of the Doctrine are explained
by the last śloka. || 28 ||

Thus is finished the fifth chapter entitled ‘the Merits of Faith’ in the ANALYSIS OF THE GERM
OF THE JEWELS, a Treatise on the Ultimate Doctrine of the Great Vehicle with the commentary
[named] ‘the Summary of meaning of the ślokas’. || 5 ||
