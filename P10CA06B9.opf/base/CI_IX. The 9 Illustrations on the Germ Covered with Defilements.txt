IX. THE 9 ILLUSTRATIONS ON THE GERM COVERED WITH DEFILEMENTS

The 9 Illustrations according to the Tathāgatagarbhasūtra. Thus have been explained the characteristics
Of the Matrix of the Buddha from 10 aspects; Now, this Matrix, as concealed by
the covering of dcfilcments Is to be known by the following illustrations. || 95 ||

Thus, with reference to the existence of the Essential Nature, as eternal as the ultimate limit
[of the world], we have hitherto explained the characteristics of the Matrix of the Tathāgata
from 10 points of View.And hereafter, with reference to the fact that the covering
of defilcments is Essentially unconnected [with the Innate Mind] although aśociating with
it since the beginninglcś time and the pure Essential Nature, likewise aśociating since the
beginningless time, Essentially connected with it [as being its own nature], it should
be understood, by illustrations based upon the Scripture, that the Matrix of the Tathāgata
is concealed by the limitless coverings of defilements. Which are the 9 illustrations?

(Kārikās 27-57) Like the Buddha in an ugly lotus flower, Like honey surrounded by bees, Like
kernels of grains covered by the husk, Like gold fallen into impurities, Like a treasure
under the ground, Like a sprout, etc. grown from a small fruit, Like an image of the Buddha
wrapped in a tattered garment. || 96 ||Like the kinghood in the womb of a poor woman, And
like a precious statue in the earthen mould; In such away, there abides this Essence In
the living beings obscured by occasional stains of defilements. || 97 ||[In these illustrations],
pollutions are like A lotus flower, bees, husk, impurities and the ground, Like the
bark of a fruit, like a tattered garment, Like a woman of misery, and like earth tormented
by the fire of pains; And the Buddha, honey, cleaned kernels 16), gold, treasure, A Nyagrodha
tree, a precious image, the Highest Lord of the world, And a purified precious statue,
The excellent Essence has a resemblance to them. || 98 ||(I) The Defilements are like
the ugly sheath of lotus flowers, and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin to the Buddha.
Suppose the Buddha, shining with a thousand marks [of virtue], Were abiding in the inside
a faded lotus flower, And a man of immaculate divine sight would perceive him And release
him from the sheath of petals of lotus; || 99 ||Similarly, the Lord, with his Buddha’s eyes,
Perceives his own nature even in those who are in the lowest world, And, being immaculate,
standing at the utmost limit and being full of Compassion, He releases them from the obscurations.
|| 100 ||Just as a person of divine sight perceives A faded and ugly lotus flower
and the Buddha within it, And rends asunder the petals [in order to draw him out]; In
the same way, the Lord perceives the world, The Matrix of the Buddha, covered with the sheath
of stains, Desire, Hatred, etc., And kills its Obscurations because of Compassion. ||
101 ||(II) The Defilements are like honey-bees, and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin
to thc honey. Suppose a clever person, having seen Honey surrounded by cloudy bees, And wishing
to get it, with skillful means, Would deprive the bees completely of it; || 102 ||Similarly,
the Great Sage, possessed of thc eyes of the Omniscience, Perceiving this Essence
known as akin to honey, Accomplishes the non-connection of the Essence With the bees-like
obscurations, completely. || 103 ||Just as a man who is desirous of getting honey Hidden
by thousands, millions of bees, Drives the bees away and makes use of the honey as he wishes;
In the same way, the immaculate Wisdom in the living beings Is like honey, and the Defilements
are like bees; The Buddha, like that man, knows how to remove the stains. || 104
||(III) The Defilements are like the outer husk, and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin
to the inner kernel. The kernel of grains covered with the husk Cannot be eaten by any person;
Those who wish to utilize it as food and the like Take it out from the husk; || 105 ||Similarly,
the Buddhahood in the living beings Is polluted with the stains of Defilements,
And unless it is freed from the aśociation of stains of Defilements, It cannot perform thc
Acts of Buddha in the Spheres. || 106 ||Just as the kernel of grains like rice, wheat,
barley, etc., As long as it is unreleased from the husk and not cleaned well, Cannot be the
sweet edible for the people; Similarly, the religious king residing in the living beings,
Having his feature unreleased from the husk of Defilemcnts, Does not become one who can
grant the pleasurable taste of the Doctrine, To the people who are affected by the hunger
of Defilcments. || 107 ||(IV) The Defilements are like a dirty place filled with impurities,
and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin to gold. Suppose a traveller would happen to drop
A piece of gold in a place filled with impurities, And the gold would stay there for many
hundreds of years As it were, without changing its quality; || 108 ||Then a god possessed
of immaculate divine eyes Would see it there and tell a man: Here is a piece of gold,
fresh and the highest of precious things. You should purify it and make use of it as a treasure;
|| 109 ||Similarly, the Buddha perceives the quality of living beings Drowned in the
Defilements which are like impurities, And pours the rain of the Doctrine over the living
beings In order to wash off that dirt of defilements. || 110 ||Just as a god, perceiving
a piece of gold, the most beautiful one, Fallen into a dirty place filled with impurities,
Would show it to the people in order to purify it from dirt; In the same way, the Buddha,
perceiving the treasure of the Buddha in the living beings Which is fallen into a big pit
of impurities of defilements, Teaches the Doctrine to the living beings in order to purify
the treasure. || 111 ||(V) The Defilements are like the underground, and the Essence of
the Tathāgata is akin to a treasure of jewels. Suppose there were an inexhaustible treasure
Under the ground within the house of a poor man; However this man might not know about
that treasure, And the latter could not say to him ‘I am here’; || 112 ||Similarly, though
there is a treasure of immaculate jewel, The inconceivable, inexhaustible properties in the
mind, The living beings of the world, without knowing it, Constantly experience the suffering
of poverty in various ways. || 113 ||Just as a treasure of jewels in the house of a
poor man Would not say to him ‘I am here’ Nor the man could know ‘here is a treasure of jewels’;
Likewise is the treasure of properties dwelling in the house of the mind, And the
living beings are like a poor man; To enable those people to obtain this treasure, The Sage
makes his appearance in the world. || 114 ||(VI) The Defilements are like the bark-covering
[of a seed], and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin to the germ within a seed. Just
as the germ of a seed inside the fruit of trees Of Mango, Tāla, etc. is of an imperishable
nature, And, being sowed in the ground, by contact with water, etc., Gradually attains the
nature of the king of trees; || 115 ||In the same way, the pure Absolute Essence, abiding
in the living beings, Covered by the sheath within the bark of the fruit of ignorance and
the like, [Grows] gradually by the help of this and that virtue And obtains [finally] the
state of the king of Sages. || 116 ||Conditioned by water, by the light of the sun, By air,
soil, time and space, From within the husk of the fruit of the Tāla or mango There comes
out a tree; Similarly, the germ of the seed of the Buddha, Residing within the bark of
the fruit, the defilements of living beings, Thrives by the help of this and that virtue,
Resulting in the tree of the Highest Truth. || 117 ||The Defilements are like a tattered garment,
and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin to a precious image. Suppose an image of
the Buddha made of precious jewels Wrapped in the tattered garment of bad smell Were cast
off on the road, and A god, perceiving it, would speak to travellers About this matter, in
order to retrieve it; || 118 ||Similarly, the One who has eyes of no obstacle Perceives,
even among those in the world of animals, The nature of the Buddha concealed by the stains
of various kinds of Defilements, And, for the sake of its liberation [from Defilements],
Provides the means [of deliverance]. || 119 ||Just as a god with divine eyes, seeing the Buddha’s
image Wrapped in a bad-smelling garment, and rejected on the road, Would show it to
the people in order to retrieve it; In the same way the Lord, perceiving even among animals,
The Essence [of the Buddha] thrown on the road of transmigration, With the covering of
the tattered garment of Defilements, Taught the Doctrine for the sake of its deliverance.
|| 120 ||The Defilements are like a pregnant woman and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin
to an Emperor contained in the Embryonal elements. Suppose an ugly woman without a protector
Were abiding in an orphanage, And, bearing the glory of royalty as an embryo, Might
not know the king in her own womb. || 121 ||The generation of worldly existence is like an
orphanage, Like a pregnant woman are the impure living beings, And the immaculate Essence
in them is like that embryo, Owing to the existence of which, they become possessed of protection.
|| 122 ||Just as a woman, whose body is covered with a dirty garment And having
ugly features, experiences in an orphanage, The greatest pain when the king is in her womb;
Similarly the living beings abiding in the house of misery, And whose mind is not quiet
by the power of Defilements, Imagine themselves without a protector Though the good protectors
are residing in their own bodies. || 123 ||(IX) The Defilements are like an earthen
mould and the Essence of the Tathāgata is akin to a golden statue. Suppose a man who knows
[how to make a statue], Seeing that the statue, filled with melted gold inside And covered
with clay outside, had become cool, Would, for purifying the inner gold, remove the outer
covering; || 124 ||Similarly, the One who has got the highest Enlightenment, Perceiving
always the radiance of the Innate Mind And the occasionality of the stains, Purifies the world,
which is like amine of jewels, from obstructions. || 125 ||Just as a statue made of
pure, shining gold Would become cool within the earthen covering, And, knowing this, a skillful
jewel-maker would remove the clay; In the same way the Omniscient perceives that The
Mind, which is like pure gold, is quiescent, And, by means of a stroke [called] the method
of teaching the Doctrine, He removes the obscurations. || 126 ||The summarized meaning of
the illustrations is as follows: Inside a lotus flower, amidst bees, Inside the husk, impurities,
and the ground, Within the bark of a fruit, within a tattered garment, In the womb
of a woman, and inside clay, respectively, || 127 ||Like the Buddha, like honey, like the
kernel of grains, Like gold, like a treasure, and like a tree, Like a precious image, like
the Emperor, And like a golden statue, || 128 ||The Innate Mind of the living beings Which
is pure from beginningless time, And is not bound by the covering of Defilements, Though
being within them from the outset is thus illustrated. || 129 ||

In brief, by this explanation of the illustrations given in the Tathāgatagarbha-sūtra, there
is shown the fact that, for all living beings, the defiling elements [which cover] over their
mind from the beginningless time are [merely] of an accidental nature, whereas the purifying
elements existing in the mind since beginningless time were born together [with the
mind], and hence, they are of an indivisible nature.Therefore, it is said: “Owing to the
impurities on the Mind, the living beings are defiled; owing to the Mind [itself], pure [by
nature], they are purified”.

(§2. 9 Kinds of Defilements the Impurities on the Mind.) Here, which are the impurities on the
Mind, with reference to which the 9 illustrations, a sheath of lotus flower, &c., have
been explained? Desire, Hatred and Ignorance, and their intense outburst, [Ignorance in] the
form of Impression The pollutions [which are to be removed by] The Path of Perception and
that of Practice, And those remaining in the impure and the pure Stages [of Bodhisattva,
respectively], || 130 ||These 9 kinds of [defilements] are illustrated By the example of
the sheath of a lotus flower and others; In their variety, however, the coverings of Defilements
Extend beyond the limit of extremity in number. || 131 ||

In brief, these 9 kinds of Defilements make always their appearance [ on the Essence of the
Tathāgata] as the incidental [ attachment], although the latter is perfectly pure by nature,
just like the sheath of a lotus flower [ covering] over the Buddha’s image, and other examples.
What are the 9 Defilements?They are, namely: 1) the Defilement characterized as the
dormant state of Desire; 2) the Defilement characterized as the dormant state of Hatred;
3) the Defilement characterized as the dormant state of Ignorance; 4) the Defilement characterized
as the intense outburst of Desire, Hatred and Ignorance; 5) the Defilement contained
in the Dwelling Place of Ignorance; 6) the Defilement to be extirpated by means of Perception;
7) the Defilement, to be extirpated by means of Practice; 8) the Defilement remaining
in the impure Stage [of Bodhisattva]; & 9) the Defilement remaining in the pure Stage
[of Bodhisattva].Now first of all, 1)-3), there are those Defilements which are in the
bodies of those worldly people who are freed from Desire, and, being the causes of Forces
which accumulate the motionless State, give rise to the Material and the Immaterial Sphere,
and which are to be killed by means of the Supermundane Wisdom. These are here termed the
Defilements characterized as the dormant state of Desire, Hatred and Ignorance.4) Next,
we have those Defilements which exist in the bodies of those living beings who indulge in
Desire and the rest, and which, being the cause of Forces that accumulate merit and demerit,
give rise only to the Sphere of Desire, and are to be killed by means of the Wisdom, [obtained]
through the Contemplation of Impurity, etc. They are called the Defilements characterized
as the intense outburst of Desire, Hatred and Ignorance.Then, 5) there are those
Defilements which are in the bodies of the Arhats, and, being the cause that produces the
Immaculate Actions, result in the birth of the pure Body made of mind, and are to be killed
by the Tathāgata’s Wisdom of Enlightenment. These are called the Defilements contained in
the Dwelling Place of, Ignorance. There are two kinds of individuals who undergo training
[on the Path]: a) the ordinary beings and b) the Saints. Now, 6) the Defilements which exist
in the body of ordinary beings training on the Path and which are to be killed by the
Wisdom [obtained through] the first Perception of the Transcendental Truth are termed the
Defilements to be extirpated by means of Perception.And, 7) the Defilements which exist in
the body of the Saints training on the Path and which are to be killed by the Wisdom [obtained
through] the Transcendental Practice of the Truth according to their [Transcendental]
Perception are called the Defilements to be extirpated by Practice.[Lastly there are two
kinds of Defilements aśociating with Bodhisattwas]. 8) Those which are in the body of Bodhisattvas
who have not reached the ultimate perfection, and which are the enemy to the Wisdom
[attained] on the [first] Stages and are to be killed by means of the Wisdom [obtained
through] the Practice of the Stages beginning with the 8th, these are called the Defilements
remaining in the impure Stage [of Bodhisattva].9) The Defilements which exist in the
body of Bodhisattvas who have reached the ultimate perfection, and which are the enemy to
the Wisdom [attained through] the Practice on the (last) Stages beginning with 8th and are
to be killed by means of the Wisdom [of the Buddha, obtained through] the Meditation called
‘the Diamond-like’, these are called the Defilements remaining in the pure Stage [of Bodhisattva].

These Nine Defilements, beginning with Desire, Being taken in short, respectively, Are illustrated
by 9 examples, That of the sheath of a lotus flower and others. || 132 ||

And, if taken in detail, [these Defilements] which are differentiated into 84,000 groups, are
as infinite as the Wisdom of the Tathāgata. On this point, therefore, it is said that the
Matrix of the Tathāgata is concealed by the coverings of Defilements which extend beyond
the limit of extremity in number.

(Variety of Living Beings according to their Defilements). The impurity [retained] in the ordinary
beings, The Arhats, the individuals in training [on the Path], And the Bodhisattvas
is [explained], respectively, By these four, one, two and two kinds of pollution. || 133
||

It has been said by the Lord that all living beings are possessed of the Matrix of the Tathāgata.
Here, ‘all living beings’ are said to be, in short, fourfold: namely, I) the ordinary
beings; 2) the Arhats; 3) the individuals in training [on the Path]; and 4) the Bodhisattvas.
Their impurity, on account of [which they cannot identify themselves with] the Immaculate
Sphere, is here explained by [the first] four, [the next] one (the 5th) and two (the
6th & 7th) and again by two (the 8th & 9th) kinds of Pollution,’01) respectively.

(§3. Concordance between the 9 lllustrations and the 9 Defilements.) Now, how should the resemblance
of 9 Defilements be known, Desire and the rest, to the sheath of a lotus flower and
others, respectively, and how should the similarity be understood between the Essence of
the Tathāgata and [the examples], the Buddha’s image and the rest?

Just as the lotus flower born from the mud Is delightful in its first appearance, But later
on [when it withers], it is no more attractive; Similar to it is the delight of Desire. ||
134 ||Just as the honey-bees, being excited, Sting sharply [and cause pain]; In the same
way, Hatred, being aroused, Produces suffering in the heart. || 135 ||Just as the kernel of
rice and others Are concealed by the outside husk, Similarly, the perception of the Essential
Truth Is hindered by the covering’09) of ignorance. || 136 ||Just as the impurities
are somewhat disagreeable; Likewise those who have got rid of desire [Regard] Passion as something
disagreeable, Being characterized as devoted to [such] Passion, The outburst of Passions
is repulsive like impurities. || 137 ||Just as the people, because of their ignorance,
Cannot obtain the treasure hidden under the ground, In a similar way, they cannot obtain
the Buddhahood Hindered by the Dwelling Place of Ignorance. || 138 ||Just as a sprout
and the like, growing gradually, Break out the husk of the seed, Similarly, by the Intuition
of the Truth, Those Defilements are removed which are to be extirpated by Perception. ||
139 ||Those who have destroyed the ground of conception of personallity Are following in
the [Practice of the] Saintly Path; Therefore, their Defilements which are to be rejected
By the Wisdom of Practice are said to be like a tattered garment. || 140 ||The stains remaining
in the [first] Stages Are like the impurities of the receptacle of an embryo, And the
non-discriminative Wisdom has a resemblance To the matured form of an embryo delivered
from its covering. || 141 ||The stains connected with the [last] Stages Are known as being
like the earthen mould, And are to be destroyed by the Wisdom of the Buddhas [Obtained through]
Meditation called ‘the Diamondlike’. || 142 ||Thus the 9 pollutions, Desire and the
rest, Have a resemblance to a lotus flower and others, And the Essence [of the Buddha], consisting
of 3-fold nature, Bears a similarity to the Buddha and the rest. || 143 ||

(§4. The 3-fold Nature of the Essence, the Purifying Element within the Mind, and its Concordance
with the 9 lllustrations.) The resemblance of the Matrix of the Tathāgata, being the
cause for purifying the Mind, in 9-fold, i. e. to the image of the Buddha and so forth, is
to be understood in the reference to the 3-fold Nature of the Matrix of the Tathāgata. What
is the 3-fold Nature?

The Nature of this [Essence] is the Absolute Body, The Reality, as well as the Germ, Which is
known by the examples, Three, one and five, [respectively]. || 144 ||

By the examples, i.e. those of the image of the Buddha, honey and the kernel [of grains], this
Essence is to be understood as being of the nature of the Absolute Body. By one example,
i.e. that of gold, its being of the nature of Reality, and by [the remaining] examples,
i.e. those of the treasure, the tree, the precious image, the highest Lord of Universe, and
the golden statue, its being of the nature of the Germ from which the kinds of Buddha’s
Body are originated [is to be understood].

(a. Dharmakāya.) Here, how is the Absolute Body? The Absolute Body is to be known in aspects,
[One] is the Absolute Entity which is perfectly immaculate, [The other] is its natural outflow,
the teaching Of the profound [truth] and of the diverse guidance. || 145 ||

The absolute body of the Buddha is to be understood in aspects, [Namely], 1) the perfectly pure
Absolute Entity itself, which is the acting sphere of Non-discriminative Wisdom; and this
is to be known in the reference to the Truth realized by the Tathāgata through introspection.And,
2) the natural outflow of the perfectly pure Absolute Entity as the cause for
its attainment, which produces the communication among other living beings according to their
faculties in discipline. And this is to be known in the reference to the Truth as the
doctrine to be taught.This teaching is again divided into two, owing to the difference of
means for exposition of the Doctrine, whether subtle or extensive. Namely, 2)-1) the Code
of Bodhisattva, the teaching by the profound means for exposition of the Doctrine referring
to the Highest Truth, and 2)-2) the Aphorism, the Scripture in prose and verse, the Prophecy,
the Verse, the Solemn Utterance, the Statement of subject matter, &c. which are the
teaching by various kinds of means for exposition of the Doctrine and are related to the Empirical
Truth.

Being supermundane, nothing can be given As an example for the Essence, in this world; Therefore,
it is shown in its similarity To the [apparitional form of the] Buddha himself. || 146
||[The Doctrine] taught by subtle, profound means Is to be known as being akin to honey
of one taste, And taught by various kinds of means, As being similar to the kernel of various
grains. || 147 ||

Thus, by examples, those of the image of the Buddha the honey and the kernel, in reference to
the meaning that all living beings, with no exception, are penetrated by the Absolute Body
of the Tathāgata, it is explained that these, all living beings, are the Matrix (interior)
of the Tathāgata, (i.e. the Matrix in which the Tathāgata penetrates). Indeed, there is
no one among the living beings who stands outside the Absolute Body of the Tathāgata, just
as no kind of physical form can exist outside of space.Because it is said: “Just as space
is considered to be all-pervading always, Similarly, it is held to be always all-pervading;
Just as space pervades all visible forms, Similarly, it pervades all the multitudes of
living beings”.

(b. Tathatā.) Being unchangeable, by nature, Sublime, and perfectly pure, Reality is illustrated
By the analogy with a piece of gold. || 148 ||

That which is the Mind, though it is aśociated with the phenomena of Suffering [caused by] innumerable
forms of Defilement, is unable to be shown as being alterable because of its being
radiant by nature. Therefore, it is called ‘Reality’ in the sense of being unchangeable
like excellent gold.This very Mind gets also the appellation of ‘the Tathāgata’ whenever
it perfects the purification from all accidental pollutions even in the case of those living
beings who are ranked among the groups in the definitely wrong way, since all of them
are not different by nature. Thus, with reference to the sense that Reality is the undifferentiated
whole, it is explained by the one example of gold, that the Tathāgata, being Reality,
is [identical with] the Matrix (i.e. the inner Essence) of these living beings.Having
in view [this] Innate Mind, the pure and non-dual Essential Nature, it is said by the Lord
153): “Here, O Mañjusrī, the Tathāgata is one who has the full knowledge about the root
of his own substratum. Through his self-purification, he has understood the purity of living
beings. That which is the purity of his own and that which is the purity of the living
beings, these two are one and the same, they cannot be divided into two.[Also] it is said:
“Though being undifferentiated among all, Reality, in case the purification is perfected,
Is [called] Buddhahood; therefore, All living beings are possessed of the Matrix of Buddhahood”.

(c. Tathāgatagotra.) The Germ [of the Buddha] is known to be twofold, Being like a treasure
and like a tree [grown] from a seed; The Innate [Germ] existing since the beginningless time
And that which has acquired the highest development. || 149 ||From this twofold Germ, it
is considered, The Bodies of the Buddha are obtained; From the first one, the first Body,
And, from the second, the latter two. || 150 ||The Body of the Absolute Essence is pure
And is known to be like the precious image, Since, by nature, it is non-artificial And is
the substratum of precious properties. || 151 ||The [Body of] Enjoyment is like the Universal
Lord Since it is the great Emperor of Religion; The Apparitional Body is like a golden
statue Since is has the nature of being an image. || 152 ||

Thus, by these examples, namely, those of a treasure, a tree, a precious image, a Lord of the
Universe, and a golden statue, in the reference to the nature as the Germ from which the
Bodies of the Buddha are originated, it is said that ‘the Matrix (i.e. the inner Essence)
of these living beings is the Essence (i.e. the cause) of the Tathāgata’.Indeed, the Buddhahood
is usually manifested in the Bodies of the Buddha. Hence, it is said that the Essence
of the Tathāgata is the cause for the acquisition of these [3 Bodies]. Here, the word ‘dhātu’
(Essence) is especially used in the sense of ‘hetu’ (a cause).So it is said: “And now,
in every living being, there exists the Essence of the Tathāgata arisen, in the form of
embryo. But these living beings do not know about it”. (Reference to the Abhidharma-sūtra
on the ‘Essence’).

Indeed, it is said [in the Scripture] as follows: “The Essence that exists since beginningless
time Is the foundation of all the elements, Owing to its existence, all Phenomenal Life,
As well as the acquisition of Nirvāṇa exists”.

Here, how is it that ‘it exists since beginningless time’? With reference to this very Matrix
of the Tathāgata, it has been taught and ascertained by the Lord: “An initial limit is not
to be perceived”. About the.’Essence’ it is said as follows: “O Lord, this Matrix of the
Tathāgata is the transcendental Matrix; the Matrix, perfectly pure by nature”.The statement
‘The foundation of all the elements’ means as follows: “Therefore, O Lord, the Matrix
of the Tathāgata is the foundation, the support, and the substratum of the immutable elements
(properties) which are Essentially connected with, indivisible from [the Absolute Entity],
and unreleased from Wisdom. [At the same time], this very Matrix of the Tathāgata is
also, O Lord, the foundation, the support, and the substratum of the [worldly] elements that
are produced by causes and conditions, which are by all means disconnected, differentiated
[from the Absolute Essence], and separated from Wisdom.The statement ‘Owing to its existence,
there is all the Phenomenal Life’ means as follows: “Owing to the existence of the
Matrix of the Tathāgata, there is Phenomenal Life, this, O Lord, is the proper saying on
account of the Phenomenal Life”.The statement ‘There is also the acquisition of the Nirvāṇa’
is said in the following sense: “O Lord, if there were no Matrix of the Tathāgata, there
would not take place aversion to Suffering, or arise desire, earnest wish, or prayer for
Nirvāṇa”. &c.
