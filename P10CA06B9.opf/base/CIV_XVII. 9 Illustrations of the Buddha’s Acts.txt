XVII. 9 ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE BUDDHA’S ACTS

(§1. Buddha’s Magnanimity.) It was said that Buddhahood is characterized as having neither origination
nor extinction. Being such, how is it pośible that from such an immutable Buddhahood,
characterized as of no manifestation, the Acts of Buddha manifest in this world; without
effort, without discrimination, without interruption, and as long as the world exists?[To
answer this question], in order to produce the faith in the sphere of the Buddha on
the part of those people who have misconception and doubt about the Buddha’s nature of magnanimity,
we have one śloka with regard to this magnanimous character of the Buddha.

(Kārikā 3) Like Indra, like the divine drum, Like clouds, like Brahma, and like the sun, Like
the wish-fulfilling gem, like an echo, Like space and like the earth, Such is the Buddha
[in his acts]. || 13 ||

(§ 2, 9 Illustrations taken from the Jñānāloka_alaṅkārasūtra.) Now, of this śloka which represents
the topics in the Scripture; a detailed exposition will be given topic by topic in
the remaining part of the text according to the same order. (I) It is said that [the Buddha
has] a resemblance to the form of Indra.

(Kārikās 4-20) Suppose here were a surface Made of an immaculate Vaiḍūrya stone, And, owing
to its clarity, there were seen on it The chief of the gods, with the multitude of Apsaras,
|| 14 || As well as his great place called Vaijayanta, Other gods and their various dwellings
Along with their divine glories. || 15 ||Suppose then, the multitudes of men and women
Abiding on this surface of the earth, Would perceive this vision And make the following
prayer: || 16 || “May we too, at an early date, Become like that chieftain of the gods!”
And, in order to obtain that state, They would abide adopting the virtues. || 17 ||Though
having no notice that this is merely a vision, They, owing to their virtuous conduct, Would
pass away from the earth and be borne to heaven. || 18 ||After all, it is an illusion, Of
no thought-construction and no activity; Nevertheless, it would appear on the earth, Being
aśociated with a great benefit. || 19 ||In the same way, the living beings, If they were
pure in their faith and so forth, And were endowed with virtues, faith and the like, Would
perceive in their own minds the vision of the Buddha, || 20 ||Who is endowed with the visible
features and marks, Who acts in manifold actual behavior like Walking, standing, sitting
and sleeping, || 21 ||Preaching the Doctrine of Quiescence, being silent, Abiding in
concentration of mind and showing The various miracles, and who has the great glory. || 22
||Having seen him, the people who are filled with desire, Undertake the attainment of the
Buddhahood, And, having brought the factors to development They do attain the desired state.
|| 23 ||After all, it is an illusion, of no thought-construction and no activity; nevertheless,
it appears in the world, being associated with a great benefit. || 24 ||Ordinary
people do not notice that this is merely a reflection of their own mind; still this manifestation
of the Buddha’s features is useful for fulfilling their aim. || 25 ||Indeed, those
who, having seen this vision, Have gradually established them selves in this method, Perceive,
with the eyes of transcendental wisdom, The Body of the Highest Truth within them
selves. || 26 ||Suppose, the earth, having become completely free from unevenness And having
become pure from within, would be as clear and white As the Vaiḍūrya stone, [because of
its] being possessed of The immaculate qualities of jewel and of pure even surface; And,
owing to its purity, there would appear on its [surface] The palace of Indra occupied by gods
around him as a vision, But, as this earth would gradually lose its qualities, The vision
[thereof] would subsequently disappear. || 27 ||For obtaining that state, the multitudes
of men and women, Whose mind intends to perform charity and the rest, Through observing
rules regarding fast and conduct, Would scatter flowers with minds full of sublime desire.
Similarly, for obtaining the shadow of the Lord of Sages On their mind which is radiant
like the Vaiḍūrya stone, The sons of the Buddha, with minds full of delight, Produce various
pictures [showing the Buddha’s life, etc.] || 28 ||Just as, on the pure surface of the
Vaiḍūrya stone, There appears the reflection of the body of the highest god; Similarly, on
the pure surface of the mind in the world, There appears the reflection of the body of the
Highest Sage. || 29||The appearance and disappearance of this reflection Occur due to the
condition of one’s own mind, Whether it be pure or impure, [respectively], And, as the feature
[of Indra or of the Buddha] Is seen only as a vision in this world, So one should not
see it as either real or unreal. || 30 ||

(II) It is said that [the word of the Buddha] has a resemblance with the celestial drum.

(Kārikās 21-25) Just as, in the heaven of the gods, Owing to the previous, virtuous experiences,
The divine drum, being apart from efforts; From a particular place, from forms of mind,
And from thought-constructions, || 31 ||Alarms all the inattentive gods again and again,
By producing the sounds of ‘evanescence’, of ‘suffering’, Of ‘impersonality’ and of ‘quiescence’;
|| 32 ||Similarly, in this world, the Buddha who is all-pervading And free from
effort and the rest, Teaches the Doctrine by his voice Towards the worthy without exception.
|| 33 ||Just as, in the heaven of the gods, the sound Of the divine drum arises due to
their own deeds, Similarly, in this world, the Doctrine, Though it is preached by the Buddha,
arises [in fact] Owing to the [previous] own deeds of the people; And just as the [celestial]
sound, being devoid of Effort, place, form and thought-construction, Brings forth
quiescence; Similarly, this Doctrine, devoid of those four, Brings forth Nirvāṇa. || 34 ||At
the time of the trouble of battle, in the city of gods, There is destruction of the victorious
play of the Asuras’ army Which is caused by the sound of drum And gives fearlessness
[among the gods]; Similarly, in this world, in preaching the Highest Path, [Buddha’s] speech
destroys, the defilements And pacifies the sufferings in the living beings, Which is
due to various practices like contemplations, Concentrations in the Immaterial Sphere and
the rest. || 35 ||

(On the superiority of the drum over the other musical instruments). Now, why has the sound
of the drum of Doctrine alone been referred to and not the cymbals and the other kinds of
celestial instrument? These are likewise produced owing to the previous virtuous deeds made
by the gods and make sound agreeable to the ear of deities. [To this, we will answer: They
are not referred to] because they have four points of diśimilarity to the Buddha’s voice.Then,
which are these [four]? They are, namely, partiality; 2) lack of benefit; 3) unpleasantness;
and 4) unconduciveness to Deliverance. [On the other hand] the drum of Doctrine
summons the multitudes of inattentive gods without exception and sounds at the right time.
For this reason it is explained as being, ‘not partial’. Owing to its protecting [gods]
from the fear of calamity caused by the invasion of Asuras and others, and owing to its enjoining
[them] to take heed, its ‘beneficiality’ is mentioned.Owing to its distinguishing
bliss from the pleasure caused by evil enjoyment and to its bringing forth pleasant bliss
in taking delight in the Doctrine, it is said to be ‘blissful’. [And lastly], Owing to its
delivering the sounds of ‘evanescence’, ‘suffering’, ‘non-substantiality‘ and ‘impersonality’,
and to its pacifying all misfortune and perturbation, the drum is explained as being
‘conducive to deliverance’. In short, the circle of the Buddha’s voice is qualified as being
similar to the drum of Doctrine through these four points.

In regard to distinguishing the circle of the Buddha’s voice, we have one verse.

Being universal, bringing benefit and bliss, And being endowed with the threefold miraculous
power, The voice of the Buddha is superior To [the sound of] the celestial cymbals. || 36
||

Now, of these four points, a brief explanation will be given in the following four verses.

The sounds of drums in heaven, though be great, cannot reach the ears of those abiding on the
earth; In this world, however, the sound of the drum of Buddha Reaches even those in the
lowest sphere of Saṃsāra. || 37 ||In heaven, the divine cymbals of a million kinds Sound
only in order to kindle the flame of desire, But one voice of those full of Compassion Sounds
in order to extinguish the cause of the fire of suffering. || 38 ||The sounds of cymbals
in heaven, though they be pure and pleasant, Are the causes for increasing the elation
of mind, The voice of 1he great Buddhas, however, Speaks of the concentration of mind in meditation.
|| 39 ||In short, that which is the cause of bliss, In heaven, on earth, as well
as In all the other numberless worlds, Is the voice [of the Buddha] which manifests Pervadingly
in the world leaving no residue; And in respect to those points, thus it is illustrated.
|| 40 ||

Now, it is indicated that the all-pervadingness [of the Buddha] through the manifestation of
body in all the worlds of the ten directions shows [his] ‘manifestation of miracles by the
supernatural power’. The illumination of the thicket of mental conduct of living beings,
as involved in the mind, by knowing the variety of spiritual elements, this is called the
‘manifestation of miracle through mind-reading’.And, with reference to the Path leading to
Deliverance, [the Buddha] preaches and instructs that Path [to the others] by the example
of the utterance of his voice. This is called ‘the manifestation of miracle through instruction’.
Thus the circle of Buddha’s voice is, like space, unimpeded and acts without interruption,
but still this voice cannot be caught everywhere or in its full extent. This is,
however, not at all the fault of the circle of the Buddha’s voice.In order to explain this
point, with reference to the self-fault of those who are not attentive, there is one śloka.

(Kārikā 26) Just as a deaf person cannot hear a subtle voice, Or even to a man of divine ears,
Not all sounds become audible, Similarly, being the object of the most subtle Wisdom, The
Doctrine, of subtle character, becomes audible Only to one whose mind is free from defilements.
|| 41 ||

(III) It is said that [the mind of the Buddha in its activity] is like a cloud. (Kārikās 27-30)
Just as, in the rainy season, the clouds discharge, without any effort, The multitudes
of water on the earth, Causing abundance of harvest; || 42 ||

In a similar manner, the Buddha Discharges the rain of the Highest Doctrine From the clouds
of Compassion, with no searching thought, For [bringing] the crops of virtue among the living
beings. || 43 ||Just as the clouds discharge the rain, Agitated by the wind, upon the
earth where The people behave in the path of virtuous actions; Similarly, the cloud that is
the Buddha Pours the rain of the Highest Doctrine As the virtues are increased in the world
Owing to the wind of Compassion. || 44 ||Bearing Wisdom and Compassion, Abiding in the
celestial sphere Without affecting anything, neither perishable nor imperishable, And being
the womb of the pure water Of meditation and mystical formulas, The cloud-like chieftain
of sages Causes the pure crops in various worlds. || 45 ||With reference to the unequality
of receptacles in measure, (Kārikā 31) Cool, sweet, clear, soft, and light Is the rain
descending from the cloud, But having touched on earth the places filled with salt, etc.,
Becomes of tastes of much variety; Similar is the rain of the 8-fold Holy Path, Descending
from the cloud, the womb abundant with Compassion, But, owing to the variety of conditions
of individuals, It assumes many kinds of taste in the living beings. || 46 ||On the impartial
attitude, (Kārikās 32-34) Those who have faith in the Highest Vehicle, Those of intermediate
nature, and those who resist the Doctrine, These are the three kinds of living beings,
And have similarity with men, peacocks and ghosts, respectively. || 47 ||Towards the
end of the summer, being of no cloud, Men and those birds who cannot fly in the sky Experience
sufferings [from lack of rain]; In the rainy season, however, because of much rainfall,
The ghosts in the ground experience sufferings; In the case of the living beings in the
world, Those desirous of the Doctrine and those hostile to it, The non-arising and the arising
of the water of Doctrine From the clouds of Compassion [cause suffering in each turn];
This is the point of similarity. || 48 ||Discharging the gross drop of rain, hail and
lightning, The cloud does not care about the subtle living beings; Nor about those who are
on a trip in the mountains; Similarly, the one who holds the waters of Wisdom and Compassion,
[Discharging them] with various means, methods and rules, subtle or gross, Does not mind
anywhere those who are of Defilements, Whether [in the burst of] egoistic view or in a
dormant state. || 49 ||On [the function of] calming the fire of Suffering, (Kārikās 35-37)
The [succession] of birth and death in beginningless time Is the Saṃsāra, in whose course
there are five Paths, And in these five Paths, there is no happiness, Just as excretion
has no good smell at all; Its suffering is constant and as if produced from The contact with
fire, swords, ice, salt and so forth; But, to pacify it, the cloud of Compassion Lets fall
the great rain of the Highest Doctrine. || 50 ||Having known that the transmigration [from
heaven], Is the suffering among gods, and, for the human beings, The searching for the
objects of desire is the suffering, The Wise men never seek for the best glory among gods
and men; It is because of their Transcendental Intellect, Because of their following the
faith in the Buddha’s words, And [consequently], because of their realizing analytically,
“This is suffering, this is its cause, and this is its extinction”. || 51 ||Illness is to
be cognized, its cause removed, Health should be attained, and a remedy used; Like that,
Suffering, its Cause, Extinction and the Path, Are to be cognized, removed, touched and observed.
|| 52 ||(IV) It is said that [the Buddha’s apparitional form] is like the great Brahmā.
(Kārikās 38-41) Just as Brahmā, without moving from his palace, Manifests his apparition,
without any effort, In the world of gods everywhere; || 53 ||Similarly, the Buddha,
without moving from the Absolute Body, Comes to the sight of the worthy, without any effort,
With his apparitional form, in all the worlds. || 54 ||Just as with Brahmā, though he never
moves from his palace, His manifestation, always pervading the World of Desire, Is seen
by gods and causes them to remove the desire of objects lit); Similarly with the Lord,
though not moving from the Absolute Body. His sight is seen by the worthy people, in all the
worlds, And causes them to remove all the stains forever. || 55 ||Because of his own original
vow, And of the pure experiences of the multitudes of gods, Brahmā manifests his apparition
without any effort; Similar is the Buddha, by means of his Apparitional Body. ||
56 ||On the invisibility [of the Apparitional form to some people], (Kārikā 42) Descent from
[the Tuṣita], entrance in the womb, Birth, and the arrival at his father’s palace, Merry
life [in the harem], wandering in solitude, The victory over the Evil One, The attainment
of the Supreme Enlightenment, And the teaching of the Path leading to the city of Peace,
The Buddha, though demonstrating such events, Does not come to the eye-sight of those who
are unhappy. || 57 ||(V) It is said that the Buddha [in his Wisdom] is like the sun. (Kārikā
43) When the sun becomes shining, at one and the same time The lotus flowers awake and
the Kumuda folds its flowers; But the sun has no discrimination in regard to the water-born
flowers. Similar is the sun of the Saint [in his acts] in the world In regard to the awakening
of virtues and closing of defects. || 58 ||(On the two kinds of people compared to
the two kinds of waterborn flowers). There are two kinds among the living beings: one is
the non-converts and the other is the converts. Of them, with reference to the converts, there
are the simile of the sun-lotus and the simile of the receptacle of pure water. Just
as the sun, without thought-construction, With his own rays, simultaneously everywhere, Lets
the lotus flowers come to blośom, And lets the other come to ripeness; || 59 ||Similarly,
the sun that is the Buddha, With the rays of the Highest Doctrine, Appears with no thought-construction,
Upon the converts resembling lotus flowers. || 60 ||With the body of the
Absolute and that of Apparition, Arising in the sky of the Seat of Enlightenment, The sun
of Omniscience pervades the world With the rays of the Transcendental Wisdom; || 61 ||From
which, everywhere in the [mind of] converts Who are like receptacles of pure water, Appear
simultaneously innumerable reflections Of that sun which is the Lord. || 62 ||Thus the
Buddhas, though they are non-discriminative, manifest themselves with visible forms and by
teaching among the three categories of living beings according to order. With reference to
this order, there is a simile of mountains: (Kārikās 44-45) Although the sun of the Buddha
pervades Always and everywhere the sky-like Universe, He casts his rays upon the converts
Who are like mountains, according to their merit. || 63 ||Just as, in this world, the sun,
Spreading out his thousands of glorious rays, Rising and illuminating the whole world,
Shines upon the mountains, high, middle, and low, gradually; Upon the groups of living beings,
according to their order. || 64 ||On the superiority of [the Buddha’s] light to [that
of the sun], (Kārikās 46-47) Of the sun, there does not exist the all-pervadingness In all
kinds of lands and in the whole sky, Nor does he show all things knowable [by removing]
The thicket of the darkness of ignorance; But those who are of the nature of Compassion,
Illuminate the world with spreading bands of rays, Produced from each hair and filled with
various colours, And manifest all things knowable. || 65 ||When the Buddhas enter the city;
Those who are of no eyes perceive the object, And, having seen it, cognize how to remove
the net of harm, And [likewise] even those blinded by ignorance, Who have fallen into the
sea of the Phenomenal World, And are obscured by the darkness of false views, Have their
intellect illumined by the light of the sun of the Buddha, And come to perceive the Truth
unseen before. || 66 ||(VI) It is said that [the Buddha’s mind in its acts] has a resemblance
to the wish-fulfilling gem. (Kārikās 48-50) Just as the wish-fulfilling gem, Though itself
is of no thought-construction, Fulfils all desires of those Living in the same region,
separately; || 67 ||Similarly, those who are of different inclinations, Having approached
the wish-fulfilling gem of the Buddha, Come to hear the Truth in its various aspects. But
the Buddha has no discrimination regarding them. || 68 ||Just as the precious jewel, having
no thought-construction, Produces the desired treasure, without effort, for others; Similarly,
the Lord always benefits others, without effort, According to their merit, as long
as the world exists. || 69 ||It is said that the Buddhas are difficult to obtain. (Kārikā
51) Here, in this world, it is quite rare To obtain the pure gem, even though the people
so much Long for it in the depth of the ocean or under the ground; Similarly, the sight
of Buddha should be known as Not easily achieved in this luckleś world By those whose mind
is afflicted by various passions. || 70 ||(VII) It is said that [the Buddha in his voice]
is like an echo. (Kārikās 52-53) Just as the sound of an echo Arising from the voice of others
Is of no discrimination and of no effort, And has no foundation, either inside or outside;
|| 71 ||In a similar way, the voice of the Buddha Arising through the voice of others
Is of no discrimination and of no effort, And has no foundation, either inside or outside.
|| 72 ||(VIII) It is said that [the Buddha’s body is] like space. (Kārikās 54-55) Being
immaterial and invisible, Without support and without foundation, Surpaśing the way of eye-sight,
Formless and incapable of being shown, || 73 ||Though being so, the sky is seen
as low and high, But, in reality, it is not like that; Similarly, all kinds of forms are seen
in the Buddha, But, in reality, the Buddha is not like that. || 74 ||(IX) It is said that
[the Buddha as the foundation of all activities] is like the earth. (Kārikās 56-57) Just
as all plants, Taking resort to the earth Which has no searching thought, Come to grow,
thrive and expand; || 75 ||Similarly, the roots of virtues in the world, Taking resort to
the ground of the Buddha Who has no searching thought, Proceed completely towards growth.
|| 76 ||(§3. Summarized Meaning of the Illustrations given by the Commentator.) Summarized
meaning of these examples is as follows: The performance of actions without effort Cannot
be seen by us. Therefore, The nine-fold examples have been related In order to clear the
doubts of the converts. || 77 ||Its purpose [of teaching] is explained By the very name of
that Scripture, Where these nine illustrations Are demonstrated in detail. || 78 ||Adorned
with this light of the great wisdom Which is the result of study, The wise men enter rapidly
In the whole region of the Buddha. || 79 ||For this reason, there are nine examples
Illustrated by the reflection of Indra On the surface of Vaiḍūrya stone, and the rest. In
this sense, you should know their summarized meaning; || 80 ||[Namely]: appearance, teaching,
pervasion, Transformation and emanation of Wisdom, Secrecy in acts by mind, speech and
body, And acquisition of those whose nature is of Compassion. || 81 ||[The Buddha’s] mind,
being of no thought-construction, Is such in which all the movements of effort are pacified
As given in the examples, beginning with the arising Of the reflection of Indra on the
pure Vaiḍūrya stone. || 82 ||The ‘proposition’ here the pacification of effort, The ‘logical
reason’ is the non-discriminativeness of mind, And, in order to establish the subject
in discussion’, There are given ‘examples’, the form of Indra, etc. || 83 ||And here the ‘subject
in discussion’ is that These nine, ‘appearance’ and the rest, Are manifested without
any effort And without birth or death of the Preceptor. || 84 ||(§4. Summary of examples
given in Kārikās.) With reference to this meaning (or subject), we have other four ślokas,
being the summary of all the examples. (Kārikās 58-61) The one who acts for the sake of
others, Without effort, as long as the world exists, Like Indra, like the divine drum, like
clouds, Like Brahmā, like the sun, like the wish-fulfilling gem, Like an echo, like the
sky and like the earth, . . . That is [the Buddha] who knows a means [of precept]. || 85
||The excellent teacher has an appearance Like the reflection of the chief of gods on the
jewel, His voice is like the [sound of] the divine drum, Having the great sphere of the clouds
of Wisdom and Mercy, He pervades an unlimited number of living beings, Up to the highest
limit of existence. || 86 ||Like Brahmā; the Buddha Shows himself variously with the apparitional
forms, Without moving from the immaculate place; Like the sun, he shines always,
spreading the light of Wisdom; And his mind [acts] like the wish-fulfi1ling gem. || 87
||Like an echo is the Buddha’s voice, Not being expressed by letters; Like space is his body,
Being all-pervading, formless and eternal; And like the earth is the State of Buddha in
this world, Being the seat of all virtues, the remedy of the whole world. || 88 ||(§5. Non-origination
and Non-extinction of the Buddhahood.) Why, then, in this exposition of examples,
is the Buddha, who is always of neither origination nor extinction, explained to be
seen with appearance and disappearance and as having actions, to work among all living beings,
without effort and without interruption? [To answer this question, there are three verses].Like
the Vaiḍūrya stone, the purity in the mind Is the cause of the Buddha’s appearance,
And this purity of mind is intensified By the irresistible faculty of faith. || 89 ||Owing
to the appearance and disappearance of purity, The forms of the Buddha appear and disappear;
But, in his Body of the Absolute that is like Indra, The Lord does never appear
nor disappear. || 90 ||Thus, his actions, apparition and the rest, Are manifested without
any effort, From the Absolute Body, which never arises nor disappears, As long as the world
exists. || 91 ||(§6. The Point of Diśimilarity.) This is the summarized meaning of similes
And this very order is told in order to show That the diśimilarity of the former example
[With the Buddha] is removed by the latter one. || 92 ||Buddhahood is like the reflection
[of Indra], But the reflection, being of no voice, is not like that; [Being endowed with
voice, the Buddha] is like The divine drum, which however does not match him, Since it is
not everywhere making benefits. || 93 ||[Being beneficial everywhere], he is like a big cloud,
Which however, having no seed of virtue, is not like him; [Being the root of virtue],
he is like great Brahmā, But, being unable to ripen perfectly, Brahmā not like him. || 94
||[As the cause of perfect maturity], he is like the sun, But the sun cannot remove darkness
fully, so it is not like him, [As the darkness-breaker], he is like the wish-fulfilling
gem, Which, however, is not as difficult to get as he is. || 95 ||The Buddha has a resemblance
to an echo, Which however, being a production of causes, is not like him, [Being of
no causes] he has a resemblance to space, Which, not being the basis of virtues, is not
like him. || 96 ||The Buddha resembles the region of the earth, Since he is the ground and
foundation For the achievement of all the virtues Of living beings, mundane and supermundane.
|| 97 ||By resorting to the Buddha’s Enlightenment, There arises the supermundane Path,
and hence, There emerges the Path of virtuous actions, Consisting or meditation, the immeasurable
mind And the absorption in the Immaterial Sphere. || 98 ||

Finished is the fourth chapter entiled ‘the Acts or the Buddha’, in the ANALYSIS OF THE GERM
OF THE JEWELS, a Treatise on the Ultimate Doctrine of the Great Vehicle with the commentary
[named], the Summary of Meaning of the ślokas.

CHAPTER V. THE MERITS OF FAITH
