III. THE JEWEL OF THE DOCTRINE

Now, from the Jewel of the Buddha, there arises the Jewel of the Doctrine. Therefore, immediately
after [the explanation of] the former, we have one śloka concerning the latter.

(Kārikā 2). I bow before the sun of the Doctrine, Which is neither non-being nor being, Nor
both being and non-being together, And neither different from being nor from non-being; Which
cannot be speculated upon and is beyond explanation, But revealed [only] by introspection
2> and is quiescent; And which, with rays of light of the immaculate Wisdom, Destroys
passion, hatred and darkness with respect to all the basis of cognition. || 9 ||

(§1. Eightfold Quality of the Doctrine.) What is shown by this śloka? Because of its being unthinkable,
non-dual, and being non-discriminative, And because of its pureness, manifestation
and hostility; The Doctrine, which is Deliverance and also by which arises Deliverance
Has the characteristics of the two Truths. || 10 ||

By this verse, in brief, the Jewel of the Doctrine is explained as being contracted by eight
qualities. Which are the eight qualities? They are 1) unthinkability, 2) non-duality, 3)
non-discriminativeness, 4) purity, 5) [being] manifest, 6) hostility [against obstacles],
7) Deliverance [from passions], and 8) cause of Deliverance.

(§2. Nirodha-satya and Mārga-satya.) Deliverance is summarized In both truths, Extinction and
Path, Which are each to be known By three qualities according to order. || 11 ||

Of these six qualities, by the first three qualities, i.e. unthinkability, non-duality and non-discriminativeness,
the Truth of Extinction is explained. From this [explanation] it should
be known that the Deliverance [itself] is contracted. And by the remaining three qualities,
i.e. purity, manifestation and hostility, the Truth of Path is explained, and from
this, it should be known that the cause of Deliverance is contracted.“That which is Deliverance”
means [the Doctrine, as] the Truth of Extinction, and “by which arises the Deliverance”
means ‘by [the Doctrine as] the Truth of Path.’ Having joined these two together, it
is explained, ‘being of the nature of Deliverance’ means ‘having characteristic of the two
purifying Truths’.

(§3. The Doctrine as the Truth of Extinction.) Because of its being beyond speculation and explanation,
And because of its being the knowledge of Saints, Unthinkability [of the Doctrine
should be known]; Because of quiescence it is non-dual and non-discriminative, And three
[qualities], purity etc., are akin to the sun. || 12 ||

1) acintyatva: Unthinkability of the Truth of Extinction, in short, should be known by three
causes. By which three? Because, 1) it is not a sphere of speculation even by four categories
[of existence], i.e. non-being, being, being and non-being together, and neither being
nor non-being; 2) it cannot be explained by any sound, voice, speech, way of speech, explanation,
agreed term, designation, conversation [and so forth]; and 3) it is to be revealed
by the introspection of Saints.

2) advayatā & 3) nirvikalpatā. How should here be understood non-duality and non-discriminativeness
of the Truth of Extinction? It is taught by the Lord as follows: “O Śāriputra, quiescent
is this Absolute Body [of the Buddha], having the nature of being non-dual and non-discriminative”.Here,
‘dual’ means ‘action’ or ‘active force’, [as by deed, word and thought]
and ‘Defilement’; ‘discrimination’ means ‘Irrational Thought’ which is the cause of origination
of Action and Defilements. By knowing deeply that this Irrational thought is extinct
by nature, consequently, there is no origination of duality and discrimination; for this
reason there is absolutely no origination of Suffering. This is called the Truth of Extinction
of Suffering. It should never be explained that, because of extinction of something,
it is [called] the Truth of Extinction of Suffering. It is said as follows:“O Mañjuśrī,
in case there is neither origination nor extinction, mental actions as mind, intellect and
consciousness never take place. Wherever no mental action takes place, there is no false
imagination by which they would think irrationally.One who applies himself with rational
thought never makes Ignorance arise. Non-arising of Ignorance means non-arising of the Twelve
Parts of Existence. It is called ‘non-birth’, and so forth”.Also said [in the scripture].
“O Lord, extinction of Suffering does not mean the disappearance of element. By the term,
‘Extinction of Suffering’, O Lord, there is designated the Absolute Body of the Tathāgata
which is beginningless, immutable, of no birth, non-originated, of no destruction, free
from destruction, eternal, constant, quiescent, everlasting, purified by nature, released
from covering of all moral defilements, and endowed with inseparable and unthinkable qualities
of the Buddha, which are far more than the sands of the Ganga in number. And this
very Absolute Body of the Tathāgata, O Lord, [when it is] unreleased from the covering of
moral defilements, is called the Matrix of Tathāgata.”Thus all the determination of the Truth
of Extinction of Suffering should be understood wholly and in detail according to Sūtras.

(§4. The Doctrine as the Truth of Path.) 4) śuddhi, 5) abhivyaktikaraṇa & 6) pratipakṣatā: Now
indeed, the way to attain the Absolute Body of Tathāgata named Extinction of Suffering
is the Path of perception and practice based upon the non discriminative Wisdom. And this
[Path] is to be known as similar to the sun with threefold common characteristics.[Namely]
1) through the common characteristic of purity of the disk, because of being apart from all
the minor defilements and stains; 2) through the common characteristic of being the manifestor
of forms, because of making manifest knowable things of all kinds; and 3) through
the common characteristic of hostility against darkness, because of being the enemy of all
kinds of obstacles against the true perception.

And ‘bondage’ means the origination of Desire, Hatred and Ignorance preceded by the thought
which takes its basis [of cognition] upon the characteristic of unreal things. It is due to
the union of the state of tendency with manifested state [of defilement].Indeed, people
regard the unreal, i.e., ‘not of its nature’ thing as the [real] characteristic because of
its desirable looks when Desire comes forth from its state of tendency; when Hatred comes
forth [from its state of tendency], [they regard the unreal thing as the real characteristic]
because of its detestable looks; and when Ignorance comes forth, then it is the same
because of its obscure looks.And of those people who incorrectly take hold of characteristics
of Desire, Hatred and Ignorance as the basis of cognition, the Irrational Thought occupies
their mind. For those people whose mind is occupied with the Irrational Thought, there
takes place the Defilement of any one of Desire, Hatred and Ignorance.Due to this [origination
of Defilement], they make the actions born of Desire by means of body, speech and thought,
and also [in the same way] they produce the action born of Hatred, the action born
of Ignorance. Furthermore, from Action there results Rebirth.Thus these people, having tendencies
[of Desire, Hatred and Ignorance], regarding the [unreal] characteristic [as real],
and making it the basis of cognition, [affectionally] hanging on it, produce the Irrational
Thought, from which consequently arises Defilement. Because of origination of Defilement,
there arises Action; from the origination of Action, there arises Rebirth. And all kinds
of impurity of these Defilements, Action, Rebirth, etc. come forth because people do not
know, nor perceive the one [real] Essence as it is.

[On the other hand] these impurities should be seen in the same manner as by a perfect investigator
who does not perceive any [unreal] characteristic nor any basis of these impurities.
[Because], when he perceives neither characteristic nor basis, then can he perceive the
Reality. Thus, these elements are perfectly realized by the Tathāgata as equal through equality.And
thus, this realization of all natures by Wisdom, as being equal without any addition
nor diminution because of these two facts, i.e. because we cannot see any characteristic
nor basis of non-being, and we can see the real character of being as the absolute truth,
this is to be known as the ‘enemy’ of all kinds of obstacles against the true perception.And
because of the origination of this enemy, there is absolutely no aśociation nor harmony
of the obstacles. This is indeed the Path of perception and practice based upon the
non-discriminative Wisdom, which is the cause of attaining the Absolute Body [of the Tathāgata]
and which is to be understood in detail according to the Sūtra named Prajnāpāramitā.
