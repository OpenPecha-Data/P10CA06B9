VII. THE SERMON: ALL LIVING BEINGS ARE POSSESSED OF THE MATRIX OF THE TATHĀGATA.

Now, with reference to ‘the Reality mingled with pollution’, it is said: All living beings are
possessed of the Matrix of the Tathāgata. By which meaning is it said thus?

(Kārikā 5) The multidudes of living beings are included in the Buddha’s Wisdom, Their immaculateness
is non-dual by nature, Its result manifests itself on the Germ of the Buddha; Therefore,
it is said: all living beings are possessed of the Matrix of the Buddha. || 27 ||[What
is shown by this śloka?] The Buddha’s Body penetrates everywhere, Reality is of undifferentiated
nature, And the Germ [of the Buddha] exists [in the living beings]. Therefore,
all living beings are always possessed of the Matrix of the Buddha. || 28 ||

In short, by three kinds of meaning, it is said by the Lord that all living beings are always
possessed of the Matrix of Tathāgata. That is to say, by the following three meanings: the
Absolute Body of the Tathāgata penetrates all living beings; the Tathāgata being the Reality,
is the undifferentiated whole; and there exists the Germ of the Tathāgata [in every
living being]. And of these three subjects, the [detailed] explanation will be made below
according to the Tathāgatagarbha-sūtra. Prior to it, however, there is [another] meaning
by which this meaning in all its aspects is indicated in the Scripture with no variance anywhere.
With reference to that as well, I shall now explain.
