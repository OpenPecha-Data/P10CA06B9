XIV. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUDDHA’S PROPERTIES

We have finished the explanation of ‘the Reality free from Pollutions’. Hereafter, we shall
speak of the ‘Properties’, which are based upon the Reality and are perfectly pure, being
indivisible from Reality by nature as the brightness, colour and shape of the jewel are inseparable
from the latter.

Therefore, immediately after [the exposition of the Reality], we have one śloka referring to
the distinct characteristics of the Buddha’s Properties. (Kārikā 1) The aim of one’s own
and that of others, [Consists in] the Body of the Highest Truth. And the Worldly Emanations
based upon it; Representing the state of Liberation and Maturation, The result is endowed
with Properties, Which appear in 64 varieties. || 1 ||What is told by this śloka? The Body
which represents the Highest Truth Is the support for the completion of one’s own [aim]
And the support for the fulfillment of others’ [aim] Is the Emanational Body of the Buddha.
|| 2 ||The first Body is endowed with properties, [10] Powers and so forth, as [the result
of] Liberation, And the second one, with [32] marks of superman, As the properties [obtained
by] the Maturation [which follows after Liberation]. || 3 ||
