XV. 64 PROPERTIES OF THE BUDDHA

Hereafter, the text refers to which are the [10] Powers and other properties and how they are
to be understood. Summary.

(Kārikā 2) The Powers [of the Buddha] are like a thunderbolt, In [breaking] the hindrance caused
by ignorance, His Intrepidity in the aśemblage is like that of a lion, The Buddha’s exclusive
properties are like space, And the two kinds of corporeal forms of the Lord are Like
the moon and its reflection in the water. || 4 ||

(I. THE 10 POWERS) It is said that the Buddha is possessed of [10] Powers. (Kārikās 3-4) The
knowledge of the proper and improper place, Of the result of former actions, and of the faculties,
Of the component elements and of the faith, Of the path which leads to everywhere.
|| 5 ||Of the impurity and purity in contemplation, etc., Of the memory of the previous
abodes, Of the Divine Eyes, and of Quiescence, Such are the ten kinds of Power [of the Buddha].
|| 6 ||It is said, [these Powers are] like a thunderbolt. (Kārikā 5) [Being the power
of knowing] about the proper and the improper, About results, about elements and various
faiths of the people, About the path, purity and impurity, About the complex of faculties,
the memory of former abodes, About the divine eyes, and how to destroy the Evil Influences;
The Powers pierce, break and cut down The armour, the mountain fortress, and the tree
of ignorance, Therefore, they have resemblance to a thunderbolt. || 7 ||(I. THE FORMS OF
INTREPIDITY) It is said that [the Buddha] has attained the kinds of intrepidity. (Kārikās
67) [The Buddha’s] Intrepidity is of four kinds, namely: In his perfect Enlightenment of all
the elements, In rejecting all obstacles, In preaching the Path, and in acquiring the Extinction.
|| 8 ||He himself knows and causes others to know All the things cognizable in
all their forms; He destroys everything to be rejected and causes others to reject them; Serves
[himself and lets others serve] in the method to be practiced; And himself attains and
causes others to attain The Highest and Perfectly Pure State which is to be attained; Thus,
teaching the Truth on account of himself and of others, The Buddha, wherever he might
be, is not paralyzed by fear. || 9 ||It is said that [the intrepidity of the Buddha] is like
[that of] a lion. (Kārikā 8) Just as the king of beasts in the forest Has always no fear
and acts without fear among beasts, Similarly, the lion who is the Lord of Sages Abides
among the assembly of attendance, Imdependent, indifferently, with firmness and victory.
|| 10 ||(III. THE 18 EXCLUSIVE PROPERTIES) It is said that the Buddha is endowed with the
18 Exlusive Properties peculiar only to him. (Kārikā 9-13) With the Preseptor, There is neither
error nor rough speech, Neither loss of memory nor distraction of mind, Also, there
is no pluralistic conception; || 11 ||He is not indifferent, not without consideration, He
knows no deprivation of his zeal, and of his energy, Of his memory, of Trancendental Intellect,
and of Liberation, And of the intuition of this liberation; || 12 ||His [three kinds
of] acts are preceded by Wisdom, And his Intuition acts unimpededly in three states of time;
These 18 and others are the Properties Of the Preceptor, which are not common to others.
|| 13 ||The Sage has neither error nor rough speech, Neither loses [his memory] nor distracts
his mind, Has neither pluralistic views nor indifference to one’s own taste, He is
never deprived of his zeal, effort and memory, Of pure, immaculate Intellect and Liberation,
Of the intuition of freedom and of showing all things knowable; || 14 ||He makes manifest
on the objects the kinds of acts, Which are preceded by all kinds of knowledge, And brings
out the Wisdom, well extensive, without hindrance, Constantly, throughout the states
of time; Thus is Buddhahood, endowed with Great Compassion, And perfectly realized by the
Buddha; And on account of this realization, he sets in motion in the world The great wheel
of the fearless Supreme Doctrine. || 15 ||It is said that [these properties are] like space.
(Kārikā 14) The nature found in the earth and the rest Is not the nature of space, And
the properties of space represented by Non-obstruction, etc., are absent in material things;
The earth, water, fire, wind and the sky, likewise, Are common to all the [material] worlds,
But the Exclusive Properties of the Buddha Are not in the least common to those worlds.
|| 16 ||(II. THE 32 MARKS OF THE SUPERMAN) It is said that the Buddha is possessed of
the corporeal form endowed with the 32 marks of the Superman. (Kārikās 15-23) The feet are
firmly placed, marked by circles on the soles, And with broad insteps and leveled heels
which hide the ankles, The fingers are long, and those of hands and toes alike Are connected
with each other by a web. || 17 ||His skin is soft and fine like that of youths, His body
is round with elevated parts, His shanks are like those of the deer, and The private parts
are concealed as with an elephant. || 18 ||The upper part of the body is like that of
a lion, The parts between the shoulders are closely set and elevated, And his shoulders are
well heaped and round; His arms are fleshy, tender and of no unevenness, || 19 ||And are
hanging low [down to the knees]. The body has a radiant, pure halo around it, His neck is
immaculate like a white conch, And his jaws have a resemblance with those of a lion. || 20
||He has forty teeth all of which are equal, And are clear and closely set, pure and straight,
And his eye-teeth are white and of excellent form. || 21 ||His tongue is broad and
long, [by which he tastes] The highest taste, infinite and unthinkable; The voice of the Self-Born
is like that of the Kalavaṅka, And has the most excellent sound. || 22 ||He, the
highest of living beings, is of beautiful eyes, like a blue lotus, with eyelashes like those
of a bull, Of handsome face, endowed with the immaculate Ūrṇa-hair, Of a head adorned with
the Uṣṇīṣa, and of skin, Purified, subtle and of golden colour; || 23 ||Hairs on the body
grow separately from each other, Soft and subtle, turning upward and to the right, Hairs
on his head are of pure blue colour like sapphires, And his figure is fully circular like
a Nyagrodha tree. || 24 ||He, the Great Sage, whose body is firm and possessed of The power
of Nārāyaṇa, looks sublime and incomparable; These 32 features of infinite splendour
are taught By the Preceptor as the marks of the Lord of Men. || 25 ||It is said that [the
Buddha, with 32 marks] has a resemblance to the moon and its reflection in the water. (Kārikā
24) Just as, in autumn, the form of the moon is perceived In the cloudless sky, as well
as in a big pond, Reflecting this blue sky on its water-surface; Similarly, the disciples
of the Buddha Can perceive the manifestations of the Omnipresent On the surface of the pond-like
sphere of the Buddha. || 26 ||

Thus these 10 Powers of the Buddha, kinds of Intrepidity, 18 Exclusive Properties of the Buddha,
as well as the 32 Marks of the Superman, being united under one head, make up the number
sixty-four.

These 64 properties are to be understood, Along with their causes for attainment, One after
the other, according to [the same] order, Through the investigation of the Ratna-sūtra. ||
27 ||

Now, of these 64 properties of the Buddha, which have been explained above, the detailed exposition
is to be known, according to the same order as before, through the investigation of
the Ratnadārikā-sūtra. Also, there have been made illustrations of four kinds about these
[4] points, respectively, viz. examples of a thunderbolt, a lion, the space, and the moon
reflected in the water. Of these examples, the summarized meaning will be given in the following
12 verses.

Being [respectively] impenetrable, with no misery, Perfectly unique and indifferent, [The Buddha’s
Properties] are illustrated By the examples of the thunderbolt, the lion, the space
And of the clear moon with her reflection in the water. || 28 ||Of the [10] Powers, six,
three, and one, Taken respectively, remove all [the obscurations] On account of the knowable,
the concentrations, And of defilements with their potential forces. || 29 ||As if they
were piercing an armour, Breaking a wall, and cutting down a tree, The Powers of the Sage
are like a thunderbolt, Being heavy, solid, firm and unbreakable. || 30 ||Why are they ‘heavy’?
Because they are ‘solid’; Why are they ‘solid’? Because they are ‘firm’; Why are they
‘firm’? Because they are ‘unbreakable’. And being ‘unbreakable’ they are like a thunderbolt.
|| 31 ||Being fearless, being indifferent, Being firm and accomplishing victory, The
lion of Sages is like a [real] lion, Has no fear amidst the assembly of audiences. || 32
||As he has got all the supernatural faculties, He abides ‘independently’ from any fear, He
is ‘indifferent’ [about his superiority], As he is unequal by nature even to the people
of purity. || 33 ||He stands ‘firmly’ since his mind is always Concentrated on all the elements
of existence, And he is ‘of the highest victory’ Since he has transcended the Dwelling
Place of Ignorance. || 34 ||With the worldlings, with the Śrāvakas, With those that act
in solitude, with the Wise, And with the Buddha, the Intellect is subtler with one after
the other; Therefore, we have illustrations in five kinds. || 35 ||[The first four are] like
the earth, water, fire and wind, Because they sustain all the world, [But the Buddha] has
a resemblance to space, Because his characters surpass everything mundane and supermundane.
|| 36 ||These 32 Properties mentioned above Represent the Body of the Absolute, Since
they are indivisible from it, As with a gem, the lustre, colour and shape. || 37 ||[On the
other hand], the 32 marks are The properties, visible and causing delight in the body, And
are based on the two Corporeal Bodies The Apparitional Body and the Body enjoying the Truth.
|| 38 ||To those who are far from purity and near to it, The pure manifestation of the
Corporeal Body is twofold, [One is] in the World, and [the other] in the circle of the
Buddha, Just as the moon shows her form in both the sky and the water. || 39 ||
