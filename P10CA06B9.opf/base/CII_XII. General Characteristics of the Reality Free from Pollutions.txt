XII. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REALITY FREE FROM POLLUTIONS

We have finished the explanation of ‘the Reality mingled with Pollutions’. Hereafter, we shall
speak of the undefiled Reality. Now, what is this ‘Reality free from Pollutions’? It is
that which is called ‘the Perfect Manifestation of the Basis (i.e. the Germ of the Buddha)’,
since, in the Immaculate Sphere of the Buddhas, [this Reality] is [absolutely] freed from
all kinds of pollutions. And this undefiled Reality is to be known in brief in the reference
to the 8 categories [which show its characteristics].

Then which are the 8 categories? [The Buddhaland is] the purity, the attainment, The liberation
[from obscurations], The action on behalf of oneself and others, And the foundation of
these two kinds of actions; Being profound, magnificent and magnanimous, It [manifests itself]
as long as the world exists, In a manner as it is. || 1 ||

Thus, by this verse, these 8 subjects are indicated according to order; namely: 1) the own nature;
2) the cause; 3) the result; 4) the function; 5) the union; 6) the manifestation; 7)
the eternal, and 8) the inconceivable character [of Manifestation].1) First of all the Essence
[of the Buddhahood], which is called by the Lord ‘the Matrix of the Tathāgata’ when
it is unreleased from the sheath of defilements, is to be understood, when it is ‘perfectly
purified as the ‘own-nature’ of the [Reality] characterized as the ‘Perfect Manifestation
of the Basis’. It is said: “O Lord, one who has no doubt about the Matrix of the Tathāgata
as it is concealed under the millions of coverings of all defilements , shall likewise
have no doubt about the Absolute Body of the Tathāgata which is freed from the coverings
of all defilements”.2) There are two kinds of knowledge. One is the ‘Supermundane, non-discriminative
[Wisdom]’ and the other, the Mundane Wisdom which is acquired afterwards [based
on the former] This supermundane and mundane Wisdom is the ‘cause’ of the Perfect Manifestation
of the Basis, and is indicated by the word ‘attainment’. [Here] it is called ‘attainment’
in the sense ‘that by which something is attained’.3) The ‘result’ [obtained by] these
[two kinds of Wisdom] is the liberation. There are two kinds of liberation, viz. the
liberation from the obscurations of defilement, and the liberation form the obscuration on
account of the knowable things, respectively. 4) The ‘function’ is the accomplishment of
one’s own aim and that of others.5) [The point that] the foundation of this function is ‘provided
with’ [the immeasurable properties] is [here called] ‘union’. 6)-8) The. Manifestation
means that [this Perfect Manifestation of the Basis] manifests itself in the forms of
three Bodies of the Buddha which are characterized by profundity, magnificence, and magnanimity,
respectively, and [manifests] ‘eternally’ i.e. ‘as long as the world exists’ and in
an ‘inconceivable’ manner.

Summary. The own nature, the cause, and the result, The function, the union, and the manifestation,
Its eternal and inconceivable character; By these points, there is the establishment
[of the Essence] In Buddhas’ Stages. || 2 ||
