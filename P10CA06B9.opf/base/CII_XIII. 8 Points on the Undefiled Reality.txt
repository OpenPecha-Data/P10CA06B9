XIII. 8 POINTS ON THE UNDEFILED REALITY

Now, we have one śloka on Buddhahood and the means for its attainment referring to the subjects
of ‘own nature’ and ‘cause’ respectively.

(Kārikā 1) Buddhahood has been spoken of as being radiant by nature, [However] as being covered
with the net of the multitude of clouds, In the form of [obstructions on account of] defilements
And knowable things which are of accidental nature, Just as the sun and the sky
[are often interrupted by clouds Though they are radiant and immaculate, respectively]; This
Buddhahood is now eternal, everlasting and constant, Being endowed with all the pure properties
of the Buddha, And is attained when the elements [of existence] take resort To the
Non-discriminative and Analytical Wisdom. || 3 ||

The meaning of this śloka is to be known in brief by the [following] verses.

Buddhahood, which is represented by The indivisible virtuous properties, Has a resemblance to
the sun and the sky In both its characters, knowledge and removal. || 4 ||It is endowed
with all the properties of the Buddha, Which are beyond the sands of the Gaṅgā in number,
And are radiant and of uncreated nature, And whose manifestations are indivisible [from itself].
|| 5 ||Because of their being unreal by nature, Because of their pervadingness and
occasionality, The obstructions of defilements and of ignorance Are illustrated as being like
clouds. || 6 ||The cause of diśolving these two obstructions is Wisdom, Which is again
considered as of two kinds, One is the Non-discriminative [Wisdom] And the other is the knowledge,
obtained afterwards. || 7 ||

(III. PHALA) It is said that the ‘own nature’ of the Perfect Manifestation of the Basis is the
‘perfect purity ‘. This purity is here, in short, of two kinds. Namely, I) the ‘innate
purity’; and 2) ‘the purity, as the result of purification’.Of them, 1) ‘the innate purity’
represents that which is Essentially free [from all stains] but actually aśociated with
them, [i.e. Reality mingled with pollutions]. Indeed, the Innate Mind, though being radiant,
is not [always] separated from the accidental pollutions. 2) ‘The purity, as a result of
purification’ represents [that which is] Essentially free and actually, too, liberated from
[all pollutions]. Because, just as water and the like become purified from dirt, impurities,
etc., the radiant Innate Mind is completely liberated from the accidental pollutions.

Now we have two ślokas about ‘the Purity, as a result of purification’ with reference to the
subject of ‘result’. (Kārikās 2-3) Like a pond, filled with pure water, Becomes abundant
with flowering lotus gradually, Like the full moon delivered from the jaws of Rāhu, Like the
sun, whose rays have been released From the covering of clouds and others, This [Buddhahood],
being endowed with pure properties, Manifest itself as being liberated. || 8 ||This
Buddhahood is [also] like the Highest of Sages, Like honey, like the kernel [of corns], like
gold, Like a precious store of jewels, like a great fruit-tree, Like an immaculate precious
image of the Buddha, Like the Highest Lord of the world, And like a golden statue 24).
|| 9 ||

The meaning of these two ślokas, in short, is to be known by the following 8 verses: The result
of the Non-discriminative Wisdom In short, is said to be akin to a pond and others, Being
pure [as the result of the removal] of Desire and other accidental defilements. || 10
||[On the other hand], the result of Wisdom, Attained on the basis of the former, is explained
As the actual sight of the Buddha’s state Pośeśed of all kinds of excellency. || 11 ||It
is like a pond filled with shining water Because of its rejecting the dirtiness of the
dust of Desire, And because of its sprinkling the water of meditation On the disciples who
are like lotus flowers. || 12 ||It has a resemblance to the immaculate full moon, Since
it has been released from the Rāhu of Hatred And since it pervades all the world With the
rays of Great Love and Compassion. || 13 ||And this Buddhahood is similar to the immaculate
sun, Because of its being free from the clouds of Ignorance, And because of its removing
the darkness of the world With the rays of its divine Wisdom. || 14 ||Being possessed of
the unequalled properties, Bringing forth the Essence of the Highest Doctrine, And being free
from the outer covering [of Defilements], It is like the Buddha, like honey and the kernel
[of grains]. || 15 ||Being pure, being freed from the poverty By the richness of its
properties, And being the giver of the fruit of Liberation, It is like gold, like a treasure,
and a tree, [respectively]. || 16 ||By its body’s being made of the jewel of the Doctrine,
Its being the Highest Lord of the human beings, And its having the appearance of the
most precious form, It is like a precious [image], a king and a golden statue. || 17 ||

(IV. KARMAN) It has been said that the two kinds of Wisdom, viz. the supermundane Non discriminative
Wisdom and the mundane knowledge, obtained afterwards on the basis of the former,
are the cause of the Perfect Manifestation of the Basis, which is called ‘the result of the
liberation’ and the ‘function’ of the Wisdom is the fulfillment of one’s own aim and of
that of others.Then, what is the ‘fulfillment of one’s own aim and of that of others’? That
which represents the attainment of the undefiled Absolute Body, as being freed from the
obstructions due to Defilements and knowable things along with their potential forces is
called the ‘fulfillment of one’s own aim ‘. And that which comes after the attainment of the
fulfillment of one’s own aim, and represents the manifestation, by means of twofold power,
viz. I) appearance in the forms of two bodies; and 2) the teaching by means of them, [both
of] which continue as long as the world exists, without any effort, it is called the
‘fulfilment of the aim of others’.

About this fulfillment of one’s own aim and of that of others, with reference to the subject
‘function’ we have three ślokas. (Kārikās 4-6) Buddhahood, being the foundation, Immaculate
and all-pervading, Of unperishable nature, and everlasting, Quiescent, constant and unchangeable,
Is, like space, the cause for the Intelligent To experience the objects through
sense-organs. || 18 ||It gives always the cause [for enjoyment] In showing the miraculous
apparitional forms, In the pure audition of its perfect preaching, In the pure scent of the
Buddhas’ morality, In tasting of the taste of the great, sublime and highest Doctrine,
|| 19 ||In the enjoyment of the pleasurable touch of meditation, And in the cognition of doctrine,
profound by its nature; [But], being the Highest Truth, the thicket of quite subtle
thinking, The Tathāgata himself, like space, is of no visible mark. || 20 ||The meaning
of these three ślokas, in brief, is to be known by the following 8 verses. The function of
the twofold Wisdom In short, is to be known as follows: [One is] the fulfillment of the
Body of [innate] liberation, [The other is] the purification of the Absolute Body. || 21 ||The
Body of innate liberation and the Absolute Body, [Although] being two [in their functions],
are to be known as one, Because they are free from passions and all-pervading, And
are the immaculate substratum. || 22 ||It is ‘free from passions’ Since the Defilements are
resisted along with impressions; Wisdom is considered as ‘pervading’ Since it has neither
attachment nor hindrance. || 23 ||The ‘absolute immutability’ is caused By its nature of
imperishability, [Here] ‘imperishability’ is a general statement, Which is explained by the
words, ‘everlasting’ etc. || 24 ||The ‘Evanescence’ is to be known as of four kinds, Being
the counterparts of ‘everlasting’ and the rest, [They are namely]: ‘putridity’, ‘disease’,
‘Annihilation’ and ‘death in an inconceivable way’. || 25 ||Because of their absence,
it is known to be ‘Everlasting’, ‘quiescent’, ‘constant’ and ‘unchangeable’ And this immaculate
Wisdom is the ‘substratum’ Since it is the support of [all] the pure elements. || 26
||Just as space, being itself of no cause, Is the cause of perceiving, hearing and so on
Of form, of sounds, of tastes, of smells, Of things touchable and of substances respectively,
|| 27 ||In the same way, the twofold [apparitional] Body, On account of its connection
with the undefiled character, Is the cause for wise men to give rise to Immaculate virtues
in the objects of sense-organs. || 28 ||

(V. YOGA) It is said that the Buddha has the character of space. This refers specially to the
absolute and exclusive character of the Buddha. So it is said: “If the Tathāgata could be
recognized merely by the 32 marks of a superman, the universal monarch, too, would turn
to be a Buddha”.

Now, there is one śloka about the highest character in reference to the subject of ‘union’.
(Kārikā 7) Being inconceivable, eternal and ever-lasting, Being quiescent, constant, and perfectly
pacified, Being all-pervading and apart from discrimination, The pure and immaculate
Buddhahood is like space, It has neither attachment nor hindrance anywhere, And, being
devoid of rough sensation, It can be neither perceived nor cognized. || 29 ||Now, the meaning
of this śloka is, in short, to be known by the following 8 verses. The [fulfillment of]
one’s own aim and of that of others Are represented by the Bodies of Liberation and of
the Absolute; On this foundation of one’s own aim and of that of others There is the ‘union’
of properties, ‘inconceivable’ and others. || 30 ||Buddhahood is accessible only to the
Wisdom of the Omniscient, And is not the object of the [kinds of ordinary] knowledge, Therefore,
it is to be known as ‘inconceivable’ [Even] for those people of intellect. || 31 ||Being
of subtle character, it is not the object of study, Being the Highest Truth, it is
not the object of thought, And, being the impenetrable Absolute Essence, It is not accessible
to the mundane meditation and the like, || 32 ||Because it has never been seen before
by ordinary persons, Like the visible forms for those who are born blind, nor even by the
Saints, Like the disk of the sun for infants lying in their mother’s bed. || 33 ||It is ‘eternal’,
as it is devoid of birth; It is ‘everlasting’ since it does not disappear; It is
‘quiescent’ because it is free from dualism, And is ‘constant’ because of endurance of Reality.
|| 34 ||It is ‘perfectly pacified’ as being the Truth of Extinction, It is ‘all-pervading’,
since it cognizes everything ; It is ‘non-discriminative’ as it has no insistence;
And ‘has no attachment’ since it rejects defilements. || 35 ||Being purified from all the
obscurations of Ignorance, It ‘has no hindrance’ in regard to everything [knowable]; Being
of soft and light-moving nature, It is ‘devoid of rough sensation’. || 36 ||Being immaterial,
it cannot be perceived, And being of no [visible] mark, it is ‘incognizable’; It is
‘pure’ since it is pure by nature, And is ‘immaculate’ because of its removal of pollutions.
|| 37 ||

(VI. VÙTTI) Now again it should be known that this Buddhahood, due to its pośession of properties
uncommon to others, manifests itself, though by means of a manifestation which is inseparable
from its immutable qualities like space, still in the forms of three immaculate
bodies, viz. ‘the Body of Absolute Essence’, ‘the Body of Enjoyment’, and ‘the Apparitional
Body’ with various inconceivable appliances like the Great skilful means, Great Compassion,
and Wisdom, in order to be the support of the welfare and happiness of all living beings,
as long as the world exists, without cessation, without interruption, and with no effort.

So, with reference to this subject of ‘manifestation’ there are ślokas about the distinction
of [three kinds of] Buddha’s Body. (Kārikās 8-11) That which has neither beginning, middle
nor end, Is indivisible, non-dual, liberated in three ways, Immaculate and non-discriminative,…
That represents the nature of the Absolute Essence, And is perceived by the Saints,
Who are concentrating their mind, striving after it; || 38 ||This [Absolute Essence] is
nothing but the pure Essence of the Tathāgatas, Which is endowed with properties, inconceivable,
unequalled, Innumerable, and surpaśing the sands of the Gaṅgā in number And has rooted
out all the defects along with impressions. || 39 ||One who exerts in concentrating for
the liberation of the world, With the body in the form of different coloured rays of the
Highest Doctrine, Has a resemblance, in his acts, to the king of wish-fulfilling gems, Appearing
in various forms, which, however, have not their own substance 99). || 40 ||That which
is the cause, in various worlds, For advancing into the Quiescent Path, For bringing
to full development and for giving prophecy, That is the Apparitional Form [of the Buddha],
Which also abides always in the Absolute Essence, As the visible forms in the element of
space. || 41 ||The summarized meaning of these ślokas are to be known by the following 20
verses: That which is called Buddhahood Is the Omniscience of the Self-born, The highest
Nirvāṇa, and the inconceivable Arhatship, Which is realized through self-introspection. ||
42 ||This [Buddhahood] manifests itself in the variety Of three Bodies, the Body of the Absolute
Essence, etc., Represented by the quality of Profundity, Of Magnificence, and of Magnanimity,
[respectively]. || 43 ||(a. The Body of the Absolute Essence.) Here, the Body
of the Absolute Essence Of the Buddha, in short, is to be known As of five characteristics,
And being possessed of five kinds of properties. || 44 ||It is ‘immutable’ and ‘indivisible’
Is ‘devoid of the two extremities’ And is ‘delivered from the Obstructions’ Of defilement,
ignorance and distraction. || 45 ||Being free from all stains and thought-construction,
And being accessible to the Saints, It is ‘radiant and pure’ Owing to the nature of the
Absolute Essence. || 46 ||‘Immeasurable’, ‘innumerable’, ‘inconceivable’, ‘incomparable’
And representing ‘the highest point of purity’; The Body of the Absolute Essence is endowed
With these [5] kinds of virtuous qualities. || 47 ||Being magnificent and numberless, Being
inaccessible to investigation, Being unique and devoid of the defiling forces, It is
‘immeasurable’ and so on, respectively. || 48 ||(b. The Body of Enjoyment.) It manifests itself
the Doctrine, owing to its nature Of enjoying the Doctrine in various forms; Being the
natural outflow of pure Compassion, It works uninterruptedly for the sake of living beings;
|| 49 ||It fulfils the aim according to the wish Without thought-construction and with
no effort; [By these points] the Body of Enjoyment is characterized Due to its power like
that of the wish-fulfilling gems. || 50 ||In teaching, in the visible form, in acting ceaselessly,
And acting with no artificial effort, And in its appearance of illusion, The variety
of [its manifestation] is said to be 5-fold. || 51 ||Just as a gem, being dyed with
various colours, Does not make manifest its real Essence; Similarly, the Lord never shows
its real nature, Though it appears in various forms, according to the conditions of the living
beings. || 52 ||(c. The Apparitional Body.) [The Buddha], being the knower of the world,
Perceiving fully the world, with Great Compassion, Manifests himself in various apparitional
forms, Without being separated from his Absolute Body. || 53 ||The [various] previous
births, The birth in the Tuṣita-heaven, and descent from it, The entrance into the womb,
and the birth [in this world], The skilfulness in various arts and works, || 54 ||Pleasurable
entertainments among ladies in the harem, The renouncement of the world, practice of
asceticism, passage to the Excellent Seat of Enlightenment, The conquest over the army of
Evil Demons, || 55 ||The [acquisition of] Enlightenment, Setting into motion the wheel of
the Doctrine, And the departure into Nirvāna; . . . all of them He shows in the impure worlds,
as long as they exist. || 56 ||[The Buddha], the knower of means, creates an aversion
To the Three Worlds among the living beings By the words, ‘evanescent’, ‘suffering’, ‘non-substantial’;
And by the word ‘quiescent’ he leads them into Nirvāṇa. || 57 ||Those who
have entered the way to Quiescence, And who imagine that they have attained Nirvāṇa, Them
he diverts from their former prejudice, Through the teaching of the True Doctrines In the
Saddharmapuṇḍarīka and other Sūtras, And, embracing Wisdom and Skilful Means, Makes them mature
in the Ultimate Vehicle, And gives prophecy for them to attain the Highest Enlightenment.
|| 58-59 ||Being subtle, accomplishing the power And toiling excessively for the company
of ordinary beings, In these points [the Buddha] should be known, respectively, As the
Profound, the Magnificent and the Magnanimous. || 60 ||Here, the first Body is the Absolute
Body, And the latter two are the Bodies in visible forms, These latter appear on the basis
of the former, As the visible forms appear in space. || 61 ||(VII. NITYA) Now this threefold
Body made manifest in order to be the support for the weal and happiness of the world,
has an ‘eternal’ character [in its manifestation]. With reference to this subject, we
have one śloka. (Kārikā 12) Having infinite causes [for the attainment of his state], Having
an endless number of living beings to convert, Being endowed with Compassion, Miraculous
Powers, Wisdom and Bliss, Governing all the elements, vanquishing the demon of Death, And
representing non-substantiality, The lord of the World is eternal. || 62 ||The summarized
meaning of this [śloka] is to be known by the following verses. Casting off his body, life
and property, He has preserved the Highest doctrine; For the benefits of all living beings,
He fulfills his first vow. || 63 ||In his Buddhahood, there is made manifest Compassion,
pure and immaculate, He shows his [four] bases of Miraculous Powers, By which power he
abides in the world; || 64 ||Owing to his Wisdom, he is liberated from The dualistic conception
of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa; By his constant practice of the inconceivable meditation,
He partakes of the complement of bliss, || 65 ||While he is acting, in the world, He is unaffected
by the worldly elements; Having attained the state of quiescence and immortality,
He leaves no room for [the activity of] the demon of Death; || 66 ||Being of an immutable
nature, The Lord is perfectly pacified from the outset; And he gives a refuge for those who
have no shelter, Because of these [10] points, he is ‘eternal’. || 67 ||The first of these
motives show The eternity of the Preceptor in his Apparitional Body, The latter demonstrate
the eternity From the viewpoint of the Absolute Body. || 68 ||Now, this method of attainment
[of Buddhahood] by the Buddhas, which represents the ‘Perfect Manifestation of the
Basis’ is to be understood as of inconceivable character. With reference to this ‘ inconceivability’,
we have one śloka. (Kārikā 13) Being unutterable, containing the Highest Truth,
Inaccessible to investigation and incomparable, Being the supreme, and relating neither
To the Phenomenal World nor to Nirvāṇa, The sphere of Buddha is inconceivable even for the
Saints. || 69 ||The summerized meaning of this [śloka] is to be understood by the following
verses. It is ‘inconceivable’ since it is unutterable It is ‘unutterable’ since it is
the Highest Truth, It is ‘the Highest Truth’ since it cannot be constructed by thought. It
is ‘beyond investigation’ since it is incomparable; || 70 ||It is ‘incomparable’ since it
is the supreme. It is ‘the supreme’ since it is not included; [Either in the Phenomenal
World or in Nirvāṇa]; ‘Not included’ means the Buddha abides in neither of the two And never
regards [in a one-sided manner] That Nirvāṇa is of merit and the other of defect. || 71
||Being subtle by the [first] motives He is inconceivable in his Absolute Body, And by the
6th, on account of his Apparitional Body, He is inconceivable because of no identification.
With either Nirvāṇa, or Phenomenal World. || 72 ||Being endowed with the Highest Wisdom,
With the Great Compassion and other virtues, The Buddha, who has attained the ultimate
point of virtue, Is inaccessible to human thought; Therefore, this final stage of the Buddha
Is unknown even to the Great Sages Who have attained the stage of Initiation. || 73 ||

Finished is the second chapter entitled ‘the Enlightenment’ in the ANALYSIS OF THE GERM OF THE
JEWELS, a Treatise on the Ultimate Doctrine of the Great Vehicle.
